# The journalism recipe book

This page contains links to a set of 'recipes' for producing different types of journalistic stories (text, audio or video).

One of the most common mistakes made by journalism students is to set out to report a story without identifying the format that they are writing in first.

The format of your story will determine everything from the type of angle you adopt, to the people you interview, and the structure that the story takes. It also determines what your audience expects you to deliver.

So, before you set out to write a story, ask yourself the following:

*Is this story going to **reveal** something new? Or is it going to **explore** something or someone?*

* A story that *reveals* something is a **news** story. 
* A story that *explores* something or someone is a **feature** story.

News and features are the two overarching **formats**, or **genres**, that all stories come under. They set the expectations of the audience, and guide everything that you do: 

* A news story, for example, will lead on the new thing, be objective (you won't use the word "I" anywhere or give your opinion), and generally shorter. Almost all news stories have the same structure, called the inverted pyramid.
* A feature story, on the other hand, will lead on a summary of what the story will do (and, often, why it's worth reading now). It will be longer, and often have sections. Features can have lots of different structures, because there are lots of different sub-genres of feature, and you'll need to decide which sub-genre you are writing.

Below are a list of news and feature genres/formats, and links to recipes on how to write each type.

## News format recipes

News formats lead on **verbs**, e.g. something that has been done or said. Story ideas can be found in problems ("concerns raised"), new information ("report says"), events and interviews ("X says Y") and responses ("X defends Y"). News stories are generally short and **time-sensitive**: that is, they are only newsworthy for a limited period of time and then become 'old news'.

* 'New report says'

## Feature format recipes

Feature formats tend to be longer and less time-sensitive than news stories - but they typically follow a news story and have a **topical hook** (a reason why they're being written now). An explainer is normally writte about a subject because it's in the news at the moment, for example, and a person might be interviewed because they have a connection to something newsworthy (their experience or expertise connects to it, for example).

### Investigations

Investigations can involve a number of stories - both news formats and feature formats. Here are some ideas:

* [The refused FOI request (using alerts on WDTK)](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/journalismrecipebook/blob/main/chapters/foialerts.md)
* Scrollytelling
* Narrative journalism
* An investigative series
* Campaigning journalism
* Solutions journalism
* 'Revealed'
* 'How we did it'

## Podcasts

There are many genres of podcast. Each has a different structure, conventions, and objective. Decide what genre you intend to make before you get too far into the production process by [checking this table of genres](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/journalismrecipebook/blob/main/chapters/podcasts.md)

## Social video

If your story is going to be told through video, make sure you identify what type of video it will be. There are many different social video genres and formats. [Here's a table that breaks down video genres, and how they differ in terms of conventions, structure, and objective](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/journalismrecipebook/blob/main/chapters/video.md).
