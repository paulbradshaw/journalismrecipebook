# How to do... an interview feature

If you're struggling for story ideas a simple solution is to find someone to interview. Here's the recipe:

1. Identify someone worth interviewing
2. Do background research
3. Identify what is likely to be most newsworthy about them
4. Make the approach
5. Prepare questions
6. Conduct the interview
7. Organise the information you have into a feature structure

## 1. Identify someone worth interviewing

An interview *feature* is different to a *news* story or a *vox pop*: it is longer, and the person being interviewed must justify that length. 

As a result, typical interviewees to consider are:

* Someone with expertise (an academic expert, or someone at the top of their profession)
* Someone with power to change people's lives (a politician or major employer for example)
* Someone with a large number of followers interested enough to read about them (celebrities, major sportspeople)
* Someone with a gripping personal story (it really has to be very unusual to justify an interview feature)

Those are listed in order of difficulty: finding someone with expertise and persuading them to speak to you is the easiest option; politicians and bosses take a little more work. Those with large followings may be in high demand and take more work, while finding people with gripping stories is hardest of all - it's more likely that you'll come across those through conversations and personal contacts, or identify potential stories which many other journalists will have too (e.g. someone who has been in the news recently)
