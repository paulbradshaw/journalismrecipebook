# How to do... an interview feature

If you're struggling for story ideas a simple solution is to find someone to interview. Here's the recipe:

1. Identify someone worth interviewing
2. Do background research
3. Identify what is likely to be most newsworthy about them
4. Make the approach
5. Prepare questions
6. Conduct the interview
7. Organise the information you have into a feature structure


## 1. Identify someone worth interviewing

An interview *feature* is different to a *news* story or a *vox pop*: it is longer, and the person being interviewed must justify that length. 

As a result, typical interviewees to consider are:

* Someone with expertise (an academic expert, or someone at the top of their profession)
* Someone with power to change people's lives (a politician or major employer for example)
* Someone with a large number of followers interested enough to read about them (celebrities, major sportspeople)
* Someone with a gripping personal story (it really has to be very unusual to justify an interview feature) - or a [number of people with important stories around a topical theme](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/aug/13/black-women-around-world-share-birth-stories-pregnancy-racism)

Those are listed in order of difficulty: finding someone with expertise and persuading them to speak to you is the easiest option; politicians and bosses take a little more work. Those with large followings may be in high demand and take more work. 

Finding people with gripping stories is hardest of all - it's more likely that you'll come across those through conversations and personal contacts, or identify potential stories which many other journalists will have too (e.g. someone who has been in the news recently)

You can find interviewees by:

* Using advanced search options in LinkedIn and similar professional networks to find people in particular roles, organisations and locations
* Using 'experts' directories' on university websites, which list academics' areas of expertise
* Looking at who is speaking at industry conferences (sites like Eventbrite, Meetup and Lanyrd are useful for finding these)
* Reading stories about a particular field and seeing you is quoted in news stories. Could they make a good subject for an interview feature?
* Identifying **topical** issues (those in the news) and then seeking out experts in that field (e.g. by searching Google Scholar or Academia.edu or LinkedIn)
* Following the publication of new research in journals that cover a particular sector (newness is topical) which is newsworthy and whose authors might be good to interview
* Calling around and asking people in a sector who they think is interesting and worth interviewing

## 2. Do background research

See if the interviewee has an LinkedIn profile which details their professional history. Their employer might also have a profile page on their website, and any conference appearances should come with a short biography. If they have a Wikipedia page check the references for more info.

Find out if the person has been interviewed or profiled in the media before ([Nexis can be useful for this](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vRPWOlzvTlZ0r5wL333kH-YsGQTrUMoeEYRAuTc9NKF1ItKJGPdq22u2S7UtwbcQIJKsJAKVXnNUai2/pub)) and what they've said on social media and blogs.

If the person is an expert, see what research they've been involved in by searching Google Scholar or Academia.edu.

Research as many contact details as you can find related to the person - their phone number and/or their organisation's phone number; their email address, social media profiles etc. These can be added to your contacts book or database in case you need them in future.

## 3. Identify what is likely to be most newsworthy about them

Make notes about aspects of that background that may be relevant now, e.g. experiences or knowledge.

Not all interviews have to have a topical hook - some can simply be about their expertise or knowledge - but it's good to find something topical (issues with high prominence in the news right now) to hang it on if you can. 

## 4. Make the approach

It's always best to approach someone by phone if you have found a number - phonecalls are much harder to ignore or put off than emails or direct messages, and you make a much stronger social connection. Even if you don't have a direct number, you can call their organisation and ask to be put through to that person (also ask what their direct line is).

Failing that, you can make an approach via direct message on their social media profile, or via email, but ask if you can call them to chat first if you can. The idea is to make a personal connection as soon as possible, which makes it more likely that they will agree to be interviewed.

When approaching a potential interviewee it's important to be professional and empathetic - but also persistent.

**Professionalism** will come in the way that you communicate: make sure that you explain who you are, and where the story would be going (e.g. Birmingham Eastside, or a publication you will be pitching to). 

**Empathy** will come in the way that you consider the recipient in the way that you make any requests. For example, avoid making demands (your assignment is not their problem!), keep the message as short as possible (every word you write is a demand on their time) and be genuinely interested in talking to them so it doesn't feel like an exploitative exchange.

**Persistence** will be demonstrated by following up on your initial approach and continuing to check in until you get a definitive response (yes or no). Don't be afraid to keep checking - sources will expect it of a journalist, and it's your job to get a result by your deadline. Just do it politely.

If you think a direct approach may not be best, consider a **go-between**. That might be the press/media office for their organisation, or their agent if they have one, or simply someone you both know. Explain that you're looking to do an interview with the person in question, and ask would they put you in touch with them.

## 5. Prepare questions

Once they agree to the interview, prepare a list of questions. Treat this as a **brainstorming exercise**: generate more questions than you need and expect to **ditch the questions that aren't good enough**. 

Choose questions that are likely to give you a strong angle to the story as a whole (i.e. those likely to generate newsworthy answers and new information) and be prepared to follow those up to get the extra information you'll also need to tell the story.

Consider the order of the questions: tougher questions might be left until later, for example, once the interviewee has relaxed a little and you've built a bit of a rapport, but don't leave them so late that you run out of time to deal with them. 

## 6. Conduct the interview

Before you conduct the interview make notes about the environment you're conducting it in (take pictures if you can, too). This allow you to add **colour** to the feature later.

When you conduct the interview make sure you don't just read out the questions you've prepared: it's vital to **listen** actively to the interviewee and what they tell you. Consider whether you need to ask them to expand on their response further, or if it raises any more questions you want to follow up with. 

Record the interview and make notes as well. It helps to include timestamps on the notes so you can locate the part of the recording it relates to, if you need to check what they said or fill in blanks you didn't get down.

Make notes about non-verbal elements of the interview too, when you can, e.g. the person's expression or body language; sounds and smells and background activity, etc. Again this will be useful for colour later.

## 7. Organise the information you have into a feature structure

Look at [examples of interviews](https://pinboard.in/u:paulbradshaw/t:interview) to get a feel for the structure that's used. Normally it's something like this:

* A headline that focuses on a quote, or a list of topics, that the interviewee has said/covered, e.g. *['I want to be mayor one day' - homeless schoolboy Isaac on cockroaches, long drives and big dreams](https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/i-want-mayor-one-day-20268054.amp)*
* A **standfirst** before the article proper begins, which names the interviewer and justifies why the person is being interviewed *now* (a topical hook), e.g. "Ahead of a new world tour, JJ Smith talks to Paul Bradshaw about friendship, loneliness, and stale crisps"
* Some background on the interviewee or the interview itself, e.g. "JJ Smith is rubbing her eyes when she walks into the room..."
* An initial quote (ideally one of the most interesting ones) - get this in early, by the second or third par
* Background, either to that quote or to the person more broadly
* Quotes and background, alternating, to keep the reader interested. You can also add colour to break it up further, e.g. "She shuffles in her chair before answering" or "A police car drives past and she is momentarily distracted".
* End on a quote - something looking forward, or broadly reflective works well - and/or on factual details about what happens next/where you can find more information (e.g. "JJ Smith's tour begins in Salford on Saturday.")
