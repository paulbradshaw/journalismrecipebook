# How to do... an interview feature

If you're struggling for story ideas a simple solution is to find someone to interview. Here's the recipe:

1. Identify someone worth interviewing
2. Do background research
3. Identify what is likely to be most newsworthy about them
4. Make the approach
5. Prepare questions
6. Conduct the interview
7. Organise the information you have into a feature structure

## 1. Identify someone worth interviewing

An interview *feature* is different to a *news* story or a *vox pop*: it is longer, and the person being interviewed must justify that length. 

As a result, typical interviewees to consider are:

* Someone with expertise (an academic expert, or someone at the top of their profession)
* Someone with power to change people's lives (a politician or major employer for example)
* Someone with a large number of followers interested enough to read about them (celebrities, major sportspeople)
* Someone with a gripping personal story (it really has to be very unusual to justify an interview feature)

Those are listed in order of difficulty: finding someone with expertise and persuading them to speak to you is the easiest option; politicians and bosses take a little more work. Those with large followings may be in high demand and take more work. 

Finding people with gripping stories is hardest of all - it's more likely that you'll come across those through conversations and personal contacts, or identify potential stories which many other journalists will have too (e.g. someone who has been in the news recently)

You can find interviewees by:

* Using advanced search options in LinkedIn and similar professional networks to find people in particular roles, organisations and locations
* Using 'experts' directories' on university websites, which list academics' areas of expertise
* Looking at who is speaking at industry conferences (sites like Eventbrite, Meetup and Lanyrd are useful for finding these)
* Reading stories about a particular field and seeing you is quoted in news stories. Could they make a good subject for an interview feature?
* Identifying **topical** issues (those in the news) and then seeking out experts in that field (e.g. by searching Google Scholar or Academia.edu or LinkedIn)
* Following the publication of new research in journals that cover a particular sector (newness is topical) which is newsworthy and whose authors might be good to interview
* Calling around and asking people in a sector who they think is interesting and worth interviewing

## 2. Do background research

See if the interviewee has an LinkedIn profile which details their professional history. Their employer might also have a profile page on their website, and any conference appearances should come with a short biography. If they have a Wikipedia page check the references for more info.

Find out if the person has been interviewed or profiled in the media before ([Nexis can be useful for this](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vRPWOlzvTlZ0r5wL333kH-YsGQTrUMoeEYRAuTc9NKF1ItKJGPdq22u2S7UtwbcQIJKsJAKVXnNUai2/pub)) and what they've said on social media and blogs.

If the person is an expert, see what research they've been involved in by searching Google Scholar or Academia.edu.

Research as many contact details as you can find related to the person - their phone number and/or their organisation's phone number; their email address, social media profiles etc. These can be added to your contacts book or database in case you need them in future.

## 3. Identify what is likely to be most newsworthy about them

Make notes about aspects of that background that may be relevant now, e.g. experiences or knowledge.

Not all interviews have to have a topical hook - some can simply be about their expertise or knowledge - but it's good to find something topical (issues with high prominence in the news right now) to hang it on if you can. 

## 4. Make the approach



It's always best to approach someone by phone if you have found a number. Even if you don't have a direct number, you can call their organisation and ask to be put through to that person (also ask what their direct line is).

If you think a direct approach may not be best, consider a go-between
