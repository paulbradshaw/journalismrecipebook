# How to: write a 'journey through' or 'tour of' feature

One format that you'll notice recurring every so often is the 'tour of' feature: this typically involves a journalist taking a tour of particular sites or locations that have something in common. That tour might take the form of a roadtrip or a pub crawl - the fundamental structure here is 'the journey'.

Examples include *[Next stop, Twatt! My tour of Britainâ€™s fantastically filthy placenames](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/jan/21/next-stop-twatt-my-tour-of-britains-fantastically-filthy-placenames?utm_term=63cbd3c3844fcd243a00412125ce815d&utm_campaign=InsideSaturday&utm_source=esp&utm_medium=Email&CMP=insidesaturday_email)*
