# How to: write a news story based on a blog post/statement

Quite often newspapers will publish a guest piece by a powerful or influential person, then write a news story about that piece. Similarly, a journalist might come across a new blog post by someone in a position of power, or a statement.

One example to learn from is [this guest opinion piece by the general secretary of Unite](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/sep/12/union-unite-labour-workers-sharon-graham), and the [related news story](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/sep/12/workers-shouldnt-wait-for-labour-victory-says-unites-sharon-graham). The same techniques can be applied to a blog post or public statement by someone newsworthy (i.e. someone with political, financial or cultural power). Make sure you don't give it more space than it deserves - and if the statement is very short you'll need reaction to flesh the story out.

## Identify the 'top line' as use that for the headline and first paragraph

Look at the piece and decide what's the most newsworthy thing that's been said. Your headline is likely to be quote-driven, e.g. '"Y", says X" or 'X: "Y"'.

In this case it's *Workers shouldn’t wait for Labour victory, says Unite’s Sharon Graham*

The first line proper (excluding any 'second headline' or standfirst) of the story should repeat this, as the story does here. Normally the *role* of the person is given rather than their name (unless they're massively famous) and you might paraphrase the quote rather than give it in full:

> *Workers should not pin all their hopes on Labour winning the next election to improve pay and conditions after the Covid-19 pandemic, the new leader of one of Britain’s biggest trade unions has warned.*

This is because the next paragraph(s) add the specifics.

## Add context to explain why it's important

The second par of any news story tends to flesh out the first par with further details on the 5Ws (who, when, where, what, how, why) and any key context. 

> *In a significant intervention weeks before Sir Keir Starmer’s first in-person party speech, Sharon Graham said Unite would “get back to what it says on the trade union tin” and expressed reservations about the limits of what MPs could achieve.*

Here it explains who (Sharon Graham) and what (the actual quote) plus a little when (weeks before...).

## Bridge to further quotes by adding more context and paraphrasing

'Where' is added in the fourth paragraph ("Writing in the Guardian...") as a bridge to more quotes. 

Paraphrasing is also used to bridge, e.g. *Graham also did not shy away from the strategy known as leverage, a form of industrial action with which she was familiar as the former head of Unite’s organising and leverage department.*

## End by looking ahead to what comes next

The final par of a news story generally adds something that is happening next, as in this case:

> *Graham will join other trade union leaders virtually at the Trades Union Congress that begins this weekend and is expected to speak on Tuesday. It will come two weeks before Starmer’s first in-person speech since being elected Labour leader in April 2020.*
