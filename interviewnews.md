# How to: write a news story based on a blog post/statement

Quite often newspapers will publish a guest piece by, or interview with, a powerful or influential person, then write a news story about that piece. Similarly, a journalist might come across a new blog post by someone in a position of power, or a statement or interview.

One example to learn from is [this guest opinion piece by the general secretary of Unite](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/sep/12/union-unite-labour-workers-sharon-graham), and the [related news story](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/sep/12/workers-shouldnt-wait-for-labour-victory-says-unites-sharon-graham). The same techniques can be applied to a blog post or public statement by someone newsworthy (i.e. someone with political, financial or cultural power). Make sure you don't give it more space than it deserves - and if the statement is very short you'll need reaction to flesh the story out.

Another example is [this interview with an actor](https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/may/06/ruth-wilson-interview-the-second-woman-luther-the-affair), and the [news story that was also written about the interview](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/06/luther-actor-ruth-wilson-hits-out-at-hollywood-metoo-hypcrisy).

## Identify the 'top line' as use that for the headline and first paragraph

Look at the piece and decide what's the most newsworthy thing that's been said. Your headline is likely to be quote-driven, e.g. '"Y", says X" or 'X: "Y"'.

In this case it's *Workers shouldn’t wait for Labour victory, says Unite’s Sharon Graham* for the guest piece, and *Luther actor Ruth Wilson hits out at Hollywood #MeToo ‘hypocrisy’* for the interview story

The first line proper (excluding any 'second headline' or standfirst) of the story should repeat this, as the story does here. Normally the *role* of the person is given rather than their name (unless they're massively famous) and you might paraphrase the quote rather than give it in full:

> *Workers should not pin all their hopes on Labour winning the next election to improve pay and conditions after the Covid-19 pandemic, the new leader of one of Britain’s biggest trade unions has warned.*

Likewise in the actor piece:

> *The actor Ruth Wilson has hit out at the “hypocrisy” of Hollywood for its handling of the #MeToo revelations in an interview with the Guardian.*

This is because the next paragraph(s) add the specifics.

## Add context to explain why it's important

The second par of any news story tends to flesh out the first par with further details on the 5Ws (who, when, where, what, how, why) and any key context. 

> *In a significant intervention weeks before Sir Keir Starmer’s first in-person party speech, Sharon Graham said Unite would “get back to what it says on the trade union tin” and expressed reservations about the limits of what MPs could achieve.*

Here it explains who (Sharon Graham) and what (the actual quote) plus a little when (weeks before...).

Similarly, the interview news piece also explains who the person is (and by extension why she's newsworthy), along with a bit more of the quote.

> *Wilson, star of Luther, The Affair and His Dark Materials, said it was “extraordinary” to witness Hollywood shift from ignoring the abusive behaviour of leading industry figures such as the now jailed Harvey Weinstein to feigning interest.*

## Bridge to further quotes by adding more context and paraphrasing

'Where' is added in the fourth paragraph ("Writing in the Guardian...") as a bridge to more quotes. 

Paraphrasing is also often used to bridge, e.g. *Graham also did not shy away from the strategy known as leverage, a form of industrial action with which she was familiar as the former head of Unite’s organising and leverage department.*

The interview news story could actually be improved with more context - the reliance on quotes makes it less engaging.

## End by looking ahead to what comes next

The final par of a news story generally adds something that is happening next, as in this case:

> *Graham will join other trade union leaders virtually at the Trades Union Congress that begins this weekend and is expected to speak on Tuesday. It will come two weeks before Starmer’s first in-person speech since being elected Labour leader in April 2020.*

With the actor interview that's not quite so easy, so another strategy is to take a quote with looks ahead in some way (this particular quote is less effective on that front):

> *“In 200 years, they’ll be looking back at images of women now going: ‘What were they doing? What is that? You’re blowing your face and lips up.’ Yet it’s a multibillion-dollar industry. And women are part of that industry, perpetuating this ‘empowerment’.”*

## Other examples to learn from

* [McCluskey accuses Starmer of reneging on pledge to reinstate Corbyn](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/sep/13/len-mccluskey-accuses-keir-starmer-reneging-pledge-reinstate-jeremy-corbyn-labour) is a news story based on the guest opinion post [I trusted Keir Starmer – until I saw how he handled Jeremy Corbyn’s suspension](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/sep/13/keir-starmer-jeremy-corbyn-suspension) - notably the headline assumes the reader knows who "McCluskey" is - only do this if you're confident your audience will. 
* [Covid Anti-Vaxxers 'Thrive On Attention' Says Downing Street](https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/anti-vaxxers-thrive-attention-downing-street_uk_61dc1e45e4b04b42ab8258e9) and [Boris Johnson Is 'Going Nowhere' Says Minister Amid Calls For PM To Resign](https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/boris-johnson-going-nowhere-michael-ellis-downing-street-party-may-20_uk_61dd7eb1e4b0d637aea70683)
 
You can spot the pattern:
Headline: Something has been said by someone (in that order: statement, then 'says X')
1st par: repeats same info from headline, with a few extra words
2nd par: background ('it comes as'/'the claims/statement was made as...')
3rd par: the quote in context ('asked X, Z replied: "quotey quote")
4th-6th par: continued quote
Further pars: more background
