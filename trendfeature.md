# How to write a trend feature

A trend feature is a format that explores a new trend in a particular field. This might be something new happening 3 times or more, or it might be based on a statement that a newsworthy figure has made that indicates a new development. 

Some examples: 

* In *[Love is all around: the rise of the fan-made film documentary](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/mar/10/fan-made-film-documentary-ghostbusters-cleanin-up-the-town)*, the reporter has noticed a new trend for fan-made film documentaries.
* In *[The rise of all-lowercase and all-uppercase song titles](https://qz.com/quartzy/1690992/the-rise-of-the-all-caps-song/)* the authors have noticed a few song titles which follow a similar pattern, and decided to gather some data to check how much of a trend it really is. A similar example is *[Christmas comes earlier in the UK, data shows](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-42356135)*
* In *[Netflix retroactively editing Stranger Things is the beginning of a dangerous TV trend](https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/culture/article/stranger-things-netflix-retroactively-editing)*, the basis of the feature is that "In an interview with Variety in early June, the [directors] confirmed plans to retrospectively edit" the series. 
* *[The Anxiety of Influencers: Educating the TikTok generation](https://harpers.org/archive/2021/06/tiktok-house-collab-house-the-anxiety-of-influencers/)* by Barrett Swanson is an example of a trend feature which uses multiple interviews and a fly-on-the-wall approach.
* *[Catgirls, clowns and astronauts â€” the wonderful world of indie VTubers](https://tomfairjourno.medium.com/386b7bc97ac1)* is another
