# How to write: a 'complex web' feature

A 'complex web' feature is a story about the connections between different companies/people in a particular network. Examples include *[Radiohead's corporate empire: inside the band's dollars and cents](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/apr/29/radiohead-corporate-structure-firms)* and *[Arsenal and Everton stakeholders' close ties laid bare in leaked files](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/nov/05/arsenal-everton-stakeholders-close-ties-leaked-files-alisher-usmanov-farhad-moshiri)*.

There is a simple way to do this type of story - as essentially a **profile** piece. Here's how:

## Map the connections

Firstly, take a trip to Companies House to look at the directors of the company you are interested in. You should also check out the 'ultimate controlling party' - that is, who ultimately owns it.

## Look at their connections

Next, start to research those directors/owners to see what other directorships they have, and other companies they own. This can get quite messy - it will help if you put each connection (e.g. directorship) on a row in a spreadsheet.

## Do background research

Now you've identified the main players and their interests, do a bit of background reading on those: how long have they had those interests, what have they been quoted as saying about them? 

## Write the 'profile'

Your piece needs to lead on the 'new' information you're about to 'reveal', e.g. "McClaren are one of the most powerful companies in Formula 1 - but few people know about the complex web of businesses that lie behind it. Jane Smith reveals who the key players are - and how they are shaping the future of racing"

That is the standfirst, introducing the piece and the author. Next you have a first paragraph of the proper story, which might tease some of the key features you've found about the web (e.g. it includes a marketing expert and someone with a background in shipping).

Next, create subheadings for each director/company, and tell us what their role is (how much of the company they own) and what you found out about them. Try to include quotes from some of the material you've drawn from (with attribution, of course).
