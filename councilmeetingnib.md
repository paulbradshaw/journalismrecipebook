# How to find and write a simple NIB about a council meeting in less than an hour

[Birmingham Council’s meetings page](https://birmingham.cmis.uk.com/birmingham/Meetings.aspx) (other councils have similar pages) allow you to see forthcoming meetings in a range of areas. These are often great sources of stories in areas ranging from arts and culture to transport, education, employment and health.

These meetings should be in your **diary**, giving you time to prepare in advance. 

Note that there are 2 main types of meeting:

* **Committees** are meetings attended by councillors responsible for that particular issue (e.g. licensing, employment). It can involve taking decisions that affect local people and businesses directly (e.g. a licensing committee decision to revoke the licence of a club), or indirectly (e.g. a decision to spend money on a new employment initiative). They can also involve scrutiny of the council, with resulting **criticism or recommendations for change**. They take place in Council House.

* **Evening meetings** with the name of an area (e.g. Northfield, Handsworth Wood) are for members of the public to raise local issues with local councillors and/or MPs and/or police. They are also an opportunity for police and other bodies to communicate local initiatives. These can be good sources of news stories. They take place locally, in different parts of Birmingham.

Here is a quick guide on what to do next to turn that lead into at least one story - and potentially more!

## The recipe

**Step 1: Read the agenda**

Click on the meeting entry and you should see a ‘documents’ section which contains an agenda and an agenda documents pack. The agenda lists what is going to be discussed at the meeting; the documents pack provides any supporting material such as reports, statements, and photos. 

Have a quick read of both the agenda and an agenda documents pack to get an idea **what is going to take place at the meeting**. That's the focus of this story.

**Step 2. Write a brief NIB saying what’s going to be happening**

You can probably write a short News In Brief (NIB) of about 2-3 paragraphs based on this alone, with a structure like this:

* Paragraph 1: Councillors are due to meet today to decide [insert what they’re doing]
* Paragraph 2: A little more background on what’s going to happen (names of councillors and other attendees who might be presenting reports), and any relevant background from the document
* Paragraph 3: Say where (which room) and when (specific time) it is and that members of the public can attend

**Step 3. Chase more details to flesh out the story or move it on**

The documents should also give names of those people expected to be attending this meeting. Make a note of these names and **identify who might be useful to chase for a quote**. 

Now try to find their contact details by using search engines and calling their organisation.

Start making calls to try to get an exclusive quote that can add more details to the story

You can also try to get a quote from an organisation or individual affected by the meeting - e.g. a business whose licence might be revoked, or a charity which operates in the field being discussed.

You can also write another story about the **background** to the meeting, if the story is big enough. 

**Step 4. Attend the meeting!**

Now you can attend the meeting and report on it having already done the basic work. You can even choose to liveblog and/or live tweet it! ([Here’s an example](https://twitter.com/ThisIsTomFair/status/1348632510763315200)) Try to get some images/video/audio while you are there, and do further interviews if you can.

You should now have material for a second story (or a third if you also did a liveblog).
