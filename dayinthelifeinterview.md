# How to: write a 'day in the life' interview feature

The 'day in the life' is a common format used to do two different types of stories: interviews, and 'behind the scenes' stories. The difference is as follows:

* A 'day in the life' behind the scenes feature tells the story of the journalist's 'day' in someone else's shoes
* A 'day in the life' interview feature tells the story of someone else's 'day'

For example, you could tell the story of 'A day in the life of a clown' by spending time as a clown yourself - or by interviewing a clown and asking them to tell you about a typical day.

Note that the 'day' in the title here very rarely refers to a single day - instead the 'day' is a 'typical' one: that is, it might combine elements of lots of different days in order to be engaging and informative.

Here's a recipe for reporting a 'day in the life' *interview* feature

1. Identify a newsworthy person to interview
2. Make the approach
3. Prepare questions
4. Conduct the interview
5. Organise the information you have into a feature structure

## 1. Identify someone worth interviewing

A day in the life interview feature is longer than a news story, so the person being interviewed must justify that length. 

As a result, typical interviewees to consider are:

* Someone working in an area which is currently topical (in the news, e.g. the asylum system, a major sporting event, etc.)
* Someone regularly involved in newsworthy events (e.g. those working in the emergency services, justice system, politics, sports, etc.)
* Someone with power to change people's lives (a politician or major employer for example)
* Someone with a large number of followers interested enough to read about them (celebrities, major sportspeople)
* Someone at the centre of a news story 

Those are listed in order of difficulty: finding someone with expertise and persuading them to speak to you is the easiest option; politicians and bosses take a little more work. Those with large followings may be in high demand and take more work. 

You can find interviewees by:

* Using advanced search options in LinkedIn and similar professional networks to find people in particular roles, organisations and locations
* Using 'experts' directories' on university websites, which list academics' areas of expertise
* Looking at who is speaking at industry conferences (sites like Eventbrite, Meetup and Lanyrd are useful for finding these)
* Reading stories about a particular field and seeing you is quoted in news stories. Could they make a good subject for an interview feature?
* Identifying **topical** issues (those in the news) and then seeking out experts in that field (e.g. by searching Google Scholar or Academia.edu or LinkedIn)
* Following the publication of new research in journals that cover a particular sector (newness is topical) which is newsworthy and whose authors might be good to interview
* Calling around and asking people in a sector who they think is interesting and worth interviewing

## 2. Make the approach

It's always best to approach someone by phone if you have found a number - phonecalls are much harder to ignore or put off than emails or direct messages, and you make a much stronger social connection. Even if you don't have a direct number, you can call their organisation and ask to be put through to that person (also ask what their direct line is).

Failing that, you can make an approach via direct message on their social media profile, or via email, but ask if you can call them to chat first if you can. The idea is to make a personal connection as soon as possible, which makes it more likely that they will agree to be interviewed.

When approaching a potential interviewee it's important to be professional and empathetic - but also persistent.

**Professionalism** will come in the way that you communicate: make sure that you explain who you are, and where the story would be going (e.g. Birmingham Eastside, or a publication you will be pitching to). 

**Empathy** will come in the way that you consider the recipient in the way that you make any requests. For example, avoid making demands (your assignment is not their problem!), keep the message as short as possible (every word you write is a demand on their time) and be genuinely interested in talking to them so it doesn't feel like an exploitative exchange.

**Persistence** will be demonstrated by following up on your initial approach and continuing to check in until you get a definitive response (yes or no). Don't be afraid to keep checking - sources will expect it of a journalist, and it's your job to get a result by your deadline. Just do it politely.

If you think a direct approach may not be best, consider a **go-between**. That might be the press/media office for their organisation, or their agent if they have one, or simply someone you both know. Explain that you're looking to do an interview with the person in question, and ask would they put you in touch with them.

## 3. Prepare questions

Once they agree to the interview, prepare a list of questions. In the 'day in the life' feature, the format gives you the main question, i.e. "What's a typical day like for you?"

But that question alone won't give you enough material for the story, so you will need to be prepared for **follow-up questions** and 

Treat this as a **brainstorming exercise**: generate more questions than you need and expect to **ditch the questions that aren't good enough**. 

Choose questions that are likely to give you a strong angle to the story as a whole (i.e. those likely to generate newsworthy answers and new information) and be prepared to follow those up to get the extra information you'll also need to tell the story.

Consider the order of the questions: tougher questions might be left until later, for example, once the interviewee has relaxed a little and you've built a bit of a rapport, but don't leave them so late that you run out of time to deal with them. 

## 6. Conduct the interview

Before you conduct the interview make notes about the environment you're conducting it in (take pictures if you can, too). This allow you to add **colour** to the feature later.

When you conduct the interview make sure you don't just read out the questions you've prepared: it's vital to **listen** actively to the interviewee and what they tell you. Consider whether you need to ask them to expand on their response further, or if it raises any more questions you want to follow up with. 

Record the interview and make notes as well. It helps to include timestamps on the notes so you can locate the part of the recording it relates to, if you need to check what they said or fill in blanks you didn't get down.

Make notes about non-verbal elements of the interview too, when you can, e.g. the person's expression or body language; sounds and smells and background activity, etc. Again this will be useful for colour later.

## 7. Organise the information you have into a feature structure

Look at [examples of interviews](https://pinboard.in/u:paulbradshaw/t:interview) to get a feel for the structure that's used. Normally it's something like this:

* A headline that focuses on a quote, or a list of topics, that the interviewee has said/covered, e.g. *['I want to be mayor one day' - homeless schoolboy Isaac on cockroaches, long drives and big dreams](https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/i-want-mayor-one-day-20268054.amp)*
* A **standfirst** before the article proper begins, which names the interviewer and justifies why the person is being interviewed *now* (a topical hook), e.g. "Ahead of a new world tour, JJ Smith talks to Paul Bradshaw about friendship, loneliness, and stale crisps"
* Some background on the interviewee or the interview itself, e.g. "JJ Smith is rubbing her eyes when she walks into the room..."
* An initial quote (ideally one of the most interesting ones) - get this in early, by the second or third par
* Background, either to that quote or to the person more broadly
* Quotes and background, alternating, to keep the reader interested. You can also add colour to break it up further, e.g. "She shuffles in her chair before answering" or "A police car drives past and she is momentarily distracted".
* End on a quote - something looking forward, or broadly reflective works well - and/or on factual details about what happens next/where you can find more information (e.g. "JJ Smith's tour begins in Salford on Saturday.")
