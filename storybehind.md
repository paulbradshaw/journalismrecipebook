# The 'story behind' article

A good basis for an article is to write the 'story behind' a newsworthy event. Sirin Kale's longform feature *[Out of thin air: the mystery of the man who fell from the sky](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/15/man-who-fell-from-the-sky-airplane-stowaway-kenya-london)* is a great example of the genre. And it also provides some useful pointers on how to plan and execute such a story.

Here are the steps:

1. Identify an event which justifies the 'story behind' approach
2. Identify key sources that you can interview
3. Identify any events that you could attend
4. Do background research

## 1. Identify an event which justifies the 'story behind' approach

The 'story behind' article is often written in the days following that event, but can also be written for a key anniversary (1 year, 5, 10, etc), or when that event becomes topical again (for example because there's an inquiry, protest, report, or other news event related to it). In some cases the story is compelling enough on its own that it doesn't matter when you publish it - it's 'timeless'.
