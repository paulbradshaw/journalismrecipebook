# How to: write a multi-interview feature

Multi-interview features involve speaking to multiple people around a particular theme. Examples of themes include:

* A key event they were all involved in
* An experience they have all had
* An industry they all work in
* A type of expertise they all share

For example the feature *[‘Keep your eyes open – and leap into the future’: 100 centenarians’ 100 tips for a life well lived](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/feb/18/100-centenarians-100-tips-for-a-life-well-lived)* sees the reporter speak to a number of people who have reached the age of 100, with the focus on their 'expertise' - or at least some authority - on what might be a factor in their longevity.

Unusually, that story is presented as a list of tips, rather than a more flowing feature. This is probably a creative solution to the limits of both the question and the interviewees: ultimately it's one question, so you're not going to get a lot of detail from any one person.
