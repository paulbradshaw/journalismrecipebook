# How to: write a multi-interview feature

When people talk about "features" the most likely genre of feature they are talking about is the **multi-interview feature**. This is a feature which focuses not on a particular person, but on an *issue*, by speaking to a range of people connected to that issue. 

Examples might include:

* A problem they are either affected by, or exploring
* A key event they were involved in
* An experience they have had, or are researching
* An industry they work in, or are experts on
* A type of expertise they share

For example, ['‘I never want you around your grandchild’: the families torn apart when adult children decide to go ‘no contact’'](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/nov/09/the-families-torn-apart-when-adult-children-decide-to-go-no-contact) explores the issue of estrangement by talking to different people involved in the issue: those directly affected, and experts in the issue. 

Another example of a multi-interview feature, ['Leaky ceilings and sinking floors: inside St Helier hospital where staff fear for patients'](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/dec/30/inside-st-helier-hospital-staff-patient-safety) speaks to those affected by the hospital, as well as those with responsibility for it. 

The feature *[‘Keep your eyes open – and leap into the future’: 100 centenarians’ 100 tips for a life well lived](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/feb/18/100-centenarians-100-tips-for-a-life-well-lived)* sees the reporter speak to a number of people who have reached the age of 100, with the focus on their 'expertise' - or at least some authority - on what might be a factor in their longevity. Unusually, that story is presented as a list of tips, rather than a more flowing feature. This is probably a creative solution to the limits of both the question and the interviewees: ultimately it's one question, so you're not going to get a lot of detail from any one person. 

And [‘Nigel Farage feels real’: why young British men are drawn to Reform](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/mar/08/nigel-farage-feels-real-why-young-british-men-are-drawn-to-reform?CMP=insidesaturday_email) seeks to answer that question by speaking to a range of people at a political rally, but also people tackling issues around masculinity.

Planning a multi-interview involves the following:

1. Identify the issue you are going to explore
2. Conduct background research to identify potential themes/sections
3. Choose the sections your story will have (the themes)
4. Identify a list of a range of potential interviewees you can speak to
5. Organise the interviews
6. Plan the interviews
7. Conduct the interviews, including photos and other media
8. Draft the story
9. Edit the story
10. Publish and distribute!
