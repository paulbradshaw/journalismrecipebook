# How to: write a multi-interview feature

Multi-interview features involve speaking to multiple people around a particular theme or issue. Examples of themes include:

* A problem they are all either affected by, or exploring
* A key event they were all involved in
* An experience they have all had, or are researching
* An industry they all work in, or are experts on
* A type of expertise they all share

For example, ['‘I never want you around your grandchild’: the families torn apart when adult children decide to go ‘no contact’'](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/nov/09/the-families-torn-apart-when-adult-children-decide-to-go-no-contact) explores the issue of estrangement by talking to different people involved in the issue: those directly affected, and experts in the issue. 

Another example of a multi-interview feature, ['Leaky ceilings and sinking floors: inside St Helier hospital where staff fear for patients'](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/dec/30/inside-st-helier-hospital-staff-patient-safety) speaks to those affected by the hospital, as well as those with responsibility for it. 

The feature *[‘Keep your eyes open – and leap into the future’: 100 centenarians’ 100 tips for a life well lived](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/feb/18/100-centenarians-100-tips-for-a-life-well-lived)* sees the reporter speak to a number of people who have reached the age of 100, with the focus on their 'expertise' - or at least some authority - on what might be a factor in their longevity. Unusually, that story is presented as a list of tips, rather than a more flowing feature. This is probably a creative solution to the limits of both the question and the interviewees: ultimately it's one question, so you're not going to get a lot of detail from any one person. 

And [‘Nigel Farage feels real’: why young British men are drawn to Reform](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/mar/08/nigel-farage-feels-real-why-young-british-men-are-drawn-to-reform?CMP=insidesaturday_email) seeks to answer that question by speaking to a range of people at a political rally, but also people tackling issues around masculinity.
