# The explainer

Explainers are a genre of article that 'explains' something currently newsworthy (such as a developing news story, new technology or trend). Typically they lead on - and *answer* - questions that people might be asking (and, crucially, typing into search engines: explainers are often heavily optimised for search engines).

The following examples give you an idea both of the angles typically taken, and the importance of a topical hook:

* *[Myanmar Coup: What You Need To Know](https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/myanmar-military-coup-explained_uk_6017a972c5b653f644d528d6)* (as a coup began in the country)
* *[Royal charters: what are they and how do they work?](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/dec/07/leveson-inquiry-royal-charter-history)* (when it was being proposed by one inquiry)
* *[How many people are sleeping on the streets?](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-47068063/how-many-people-are-sleeping-rough-in-england)* (as new figures hit the headlines)
* *[World Cup 2018: Everything you need to know in seven charts](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/44388118)* (as the tournament is about to begin)

Sometimes these answer 'What' and 'how' questions, with "What you need to know about..." or "Everything you need to know" being commonly employed. The **listicle** (structuring the information into a numbered series of pieces of information) or **charticle** format (the same, but with a chart for each item) is also often used.

Here's the recipe:

1. Identify a news story that is likely to make audiences ask questions
2. Identify the sorts of questions they might be asking
3. Research the answers to those questions
4. Select the most relevant and trustworthy information and structure it into an article

## 1. Identify a news story that is likely to make audiences ask questions

Good candidates for an explainer include:

* A developing news story (as in the case of *[Myanmar Coup: What You Need To Know](https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/myanmar-military-coup-explained_uk_6017a972c5b653f644d528d6)*)
* A news story which includes important context/complexity (*[How many people are sleeping on the streets?](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-47068063/how-many-people-are-sleeping-rough-in-england)*) 
* Proposals that need explaining (*[Royal charters: what are they and how do they work?](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/dec/07/leveson-inquiry-royal-charter-history)*)
* New technologies or research which includes important context/complexity
* An upcoming news event (*[World Cup 2018: Everything you need to know in seven charts](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/44388118)*)
* A factcheck
