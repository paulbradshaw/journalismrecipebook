# How to: write a news story based on a panel event

Panel discussions and public talks are good material for news stories. Often the story focuses on the most newsworthy thing that someone has said there - see how the same event was reported in two different ways [by openDemocracy](https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/freedom-of-information/uk-government-must-abolish-pernicious-unit-blocking-foi-requests-says-senior-tory/) ("*UK government must abolish ‘pernicious’ unit blocking FOI requests, says senior Tory*") [and Camden New Journal](http://camdennewjournal.com/article/freedom-of-information-act-failing-due-to-obsession-with-secrecy-says-creator) ("*Freedom of information Act failing due to ‘obsession with secrecy’, says creator*") - but how both follow the same 'person says X' angle.

Here's a recipe for reporting a story based on a panel event.

1. Find an event
2. Do background research
3. Make notes at the event
4. Write up the results

## 1. Find an event

Sites like Eventbrite, Meetup and Lanyrd are useful for finding events where people are speaking. You can also look on [Facebook events](https://www.facebook.com/events/) in your area or field. Add them to your news diary (these are often good backup options when you need other ideas after one falls through). 

Identify one to attend.

## 2. Do background research

Try to find out a little bit about the speakers: look for a profile on LinkedIn to find out more about their professional history and achievements. Their employer might also have a profile page on their website - the event should include a short biography. 

Find out if they have been interviewed or profiled in the media before (Nexis can be useful for this) and what they've said on social media and blogs.

If a person is an expert, see what research they've been involved in by searching Google Scholar or Academia.edu.

Research as many contact details as you can find related to each person - their phone number and/or their organisation's phone number; their email address, social media profiles etc. These can be added to your contacts book or database in case you need them in future.

## 3. Make notes at the event (and take pictures)

When following the event you're primarily looking for the most newsworthy quote that's said - but you also need other information to flesh out the story. 

Try to record the event but don't assume you'll get clear audio - sitting towards the front will help and you can also ask if you can put your recorder (or phone if you're using that) on the table where the speakers are.

But don't rely on the recording - that's just a backup.

Take notes on what's said as your main reference (add timings if you can so you can check the recording too). 

Take photos at the start and end (when you're less likely to take notes) so you have some images for the piece.

As the event progresses you may start to get an idea for the aspect which might be the strongest angle. Of course there may well be more than one - in which case you can write more than one story (but don't try to mix them all up in one).

There is often time for questions at the end, so have some questions prepared which might give you a strong angle.

Make sure you have enough material and you understand it all. If you aren't sure about a quote, try to speak to the speaker afterwards (or ask a question at the end) to clarify. 


## 4. Write up the results

Look at the examples linked above to get a feel for the structure of a panel report. Typically it will be something like this:

* A headline that is *"quote", says X*
* A first paragraph that paraphrases and expands a little on the same information, e.g. *"The peer who helped set up the UK’s freedom of information laws said the system has been failing because civil servants remained “obsessed with secrecy”.*
* A second par that names the person (**who**) and details **where** and **when** this was said ("*Lord David Clark of Windermere lamented what had become of the system as he appeared at a debate jointly held by the Open Democracy news site and SOAS, the university in Bloomsbury.*")
* Some background about that person and/or the quote ("*Twenty years ago, he was asked by then prime minister Tony Blair to set up a system...*")
* Some quotes ("*He told the online meeting: “Almost daily I get people talking to me about FOI, and they all come up with the same stories now.*")
* More background
* More quotes
* More background (and so on)
* Towards the end of the article you might add a quote or two from other speakers, but not so much that it becomes a second article. One quote from each person should be enough, e.g. "*The meeting heard from Conservative MP David Davis, who said that FOI should be strengthened. “I think we need to put more pressure on the ICO to be more aggressive,” he said, adding that a new Official Secrets Act being discussed should not remove public interest clauses.*"). Ending on one of these quotes is a good way to wrap the story up.
