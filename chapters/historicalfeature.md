# How to write... a historical feature

It doesn't happen regularly, but every so often a journalist will pitch a story from history. Why? Because current events make that history newsworthy.

Take ['How Manchester City and the league locked horns in a financial scandal - in 1906'](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/mar/30/manchester-city-sunderland-premier-league-charges-football). It's a story that's over a century old - but the introduction to the story makes it clear just how relevant and topical it is:

> There is a sense that the 130‑plus Premier League charges Manchester City are facing are unprecedented, and in terms of the potential fallout that may be true. City have the wealth and, it seems, the will to pursue extraordinarily costly legal action. If they are found guilty – and it should be stressed that they deny all charges – the implications for the club and the league could be seismic. But the charges are not unprecedented. Twice before in the 150‑year history of English football, clubs have faced major investigations into illegal payments. Both had hugely significant consequences for the clubs involved.

You are more likely to spot an opportunity for a historical feature if you read widely, and are curious.

How does a story like this come about? There are two likely scenarios:

1. A journalist or editor notices parallels between current events and historical events that they have read about. They pitch it as a story: "Why don't I do a story about what happened in X, and what it can tell us about events now?"
2. A journalist or editor asks the question of current events: "Has this ever happened before? What did they do then? Let's find out and do a story about it."
3. There's a third possibility which is a combination of the above. Journalist: "This happened before - I could do a story about that." Editor: "See if there are any other times it's happened too - that will make it a stronger feature."
