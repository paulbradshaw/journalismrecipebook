# Vox pop feature

A vox pop (short for 'vox populi', Latin for 'voice of the people') is the process of asking people - typically in the street - for their thoughts on a particular issue.

The process is widely used in the news industry as a way of **fleshing out stories** - but it is a technique that is also very easy to *misuse*, in place of a story (it is also very easy to *do badly*, by not speaking to people but instead taking their opinions from social media).

Although most vox pops are conducted to add extra detail to a story which includes some original reporting, there is an exception. This doesn't have a name, so we will call it a 'vox pop feature'

## The 'vox pop feature'

An example of the vox pop feature can be found in *[‘There’s nowhere else like this’: the backlash against plans for a Gail’s bakery in Walthamstow](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/article/2024/aug/16/backlash-over-gails-bakery-plan-in-walthamstow-village)* by Esther Addley. 

The format is broadly similar to a multi-interview feature: a topical issue ("the diners and shoppers of Walthamstow village this week found themselves at odds with one of Britain’s fastest-growing cafe groups") provides the 'hook' for the story, and the journalist has set out to speak to people who can shed more light on it. 

However, in this case instead of speaking to experts and case studies, the reporter speaks to people on the street in question.

Notably, alongside the 'person on the street' interviews, the story still seeks out some voices with authority to provide some vital context at the end: Amy North, the editor of British Baker magazine, and Adam Leyland, the editor-in-chief of the Grocer.
