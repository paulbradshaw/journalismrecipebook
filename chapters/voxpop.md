# Vox pops - and how to do a vox pop feature

A vox pop (short for 'vox populi', Latin for 'voice of the people') is the process of asking people - typically in the street - for their thoughts on a particular issue.

The process is widely used in the news industry as a way of **adding colour to stories**, for example at the end of, alongside, or following, a news story, or in the middle of a news package - but it is a technique that is also very easy to *misuse*, in place of a story (it is also very easy to *do badly*, by not speaking to people but instead taking their opinions from social media, which audiences can find themselves anyway).

There are many criticisms of vox pops which it is important to be aware of. The main criticism is that they add nothing of substance to a story (random people do not have any expertise, experience, or power in relation to the story). A second is that it is lazy journalism (creating content but not anything useful or informative), and a third is that it can actively *misrepresent* the diversity and/or balance of public opinion. 

The most extreme example of this misrepresentation is [taking social media updates as the source](https://www.cjr.org/analysis/tweets-media.php) of the vox pop: ocial media users are not representative of the population as a whole, and the most vocal tend to have the most extreme views, so the quotes taken will reflect that. 

But even grabbing people in a city centre street and interviewing them will result in an **unrepresentative** sample: it only gives a voice to those in a major urban centre, and those who are on the street at that point of day (and those with the confidence and time to speak). People like office workers, tourists and students are more likely to be there and speak to you. Those with caring responsibilities and disabilities, manual workers and the unemployed and retired are less likely to be given a voice. 

If the resulting voices are then chosen to represent a 'for' and 'against' opinion regardless of the balance of those opinions (e.g. most people are against) then this will further misrepresent the 'voice of the people'.

Aside from the issues above, the vox pop should almost never *be* the story - it only adds extra information to a story that is revealing something new.

There is an exception to the typical vox pop fleshing out a news story, however. This is more of a feature format, and doesn't have a name, so we will call it a 'vox pop feature'

## The 'vox pop feature'

An example of the vox pop feature can be found in *[‘There’s nowhere else like this’: the backlash against plans for a Gail’s bakery in Walthamstow](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/article/2024/aug/16/backlash-over-gails-bakery-plan-in-walthamstow-village)* by Esther Addley. Read this first to see how the vox pops are used - and most importantly, why.

The format is broadly similar to a [multi-interview feature](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/journalismrecipebook/blob/main/multi_interview_feature.md): a topical issue ("the diners and shoppers of Walthamstow village this week found themselves at odds with one of Britain’s fastest-growing cafe groups") provides the 'hook' for the story, and the journalist has set out to speak to people who can shed more light on it. 

However, in this case instead of speaking to experts and case studies, the reporter speaks to people on the street in question.

The vox pop approach is justified here because the story relates to a small geographical location. This means that the 'person on the street' becomes more than just the source of a random opinion. Instead, they provide a source of verification for claims being made about them. 

Put another way, the story is about people on that street *specifically*. 

Crucial to the story is speaking to a **lot** of people. Alongside the specific quotes used, there should be some indication of those whose quotes are not included for space reasons. Here's a key section which does that:

> "Like many to whom the Guardian spoke in the village, she was aware of the debate over the Gail’s proposal, and generally opposed it."

What this line also does is avoid the 'false balance' problem in choosing a 50/50 balance of quotes from different sides of the issue. It makes the balance of opinion (generally opposed) clear. 

Notably also, alongside the 'person on the street' interviews, the story still seeks out some voices with authority to provide some vital context at the end: Amy North, the editor of British Baker magazine, and Adam Leyland, the editor-in-chief of the Grocer. 

### How to write a vox pop feature

1. Identify a current story that relates to a specific location that can be visited 
2. Visit the location and speak to as many people as possible. Make sure to get their full name, age and occupation. (If they do not wish to give those details, you will need to explain this in the story)
3. Make notes about the location, too, and take photos - you'll need this colour
4. Identify other sources - experts, representatives, people in power - and speak to those too
5. Write up the feature following the structure in [the example](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/article/2024/aug/16/backlash-over-gails-bakery-plan-in-walthamstow-village): a quote-based headline; a standfirst that sums up what the story is going to say or do; some background context; and the quotes broken up with further context and colour. The expert quotes are good to end with because they are likely to look forward at the wider implications.
6. Edit: cut out quotes or parts of quotes that aren't essential. Make sure the article properly represents the balance of opinion of the people whose quotes you don't use. Make sure any questions that the story raises are answered.
