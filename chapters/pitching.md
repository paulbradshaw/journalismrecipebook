# Pitching tips:

1. Say what the format/genre is of the story you are pitching: is it a news story or a feature? If it’s a feature, say what type
2. Say what the story will do: if it’s a news story, say what it will **reveal**. If it’s a feature, say what it will **explore**. More on this below.
3. Say what you can bring to the story. For example, “I have done exclusive data analysis of X” or “I have obtained interviews with Y and Z” or “I have organised exclusive access to X” or “I have written a number of stories in this field and have a good understanding of the issues and people involved” or “I have already done X”.

What news stories reveal:
  * Something new that someone has **said**. For example they have 'called for' action, or 'criticised' an organisation or decision, or 'denied' something or otherwise reacted (e.g. explained), or 'announced'
  * Something new that has **happened**. For example, a conference, celebration, cultural event, or an event like an accident or crime (you can't pitch these stories as you don't know the accident/crime will happen in advance) 
  * Something that new data, or new analysis 'by Birmingham Eastside' (or your publication/programme), has revealed 

What features reveal depends on the format/genre of the feature:
* A format like an **explainer, listicle or charticle** often takes a current event and explores ‘what you need to know’.
* A format like an interview feature might explore ‘expert insights’ into an issue such as why it is a problem and what needs to be done about it.
* Or it might explore ‘what it was like’ (to experience something) if the interviewee had a newsworthy experience (a human interest feature).
* Or it might explore ‘practical tips’ if the interviewee is a practical expert (e.g. an award-winner).
* Or it might explore a person’s ‘journey’ if they are culturally powerful or successful.
