# How to write a story based on an official report or research

One of the most common sources of news story is an official report. Reports are published by a range of organisations, from government departments and bodies, to local government and scrutiny committees, health boards, regulators, charities, unions, campaign groups and academic teams.

Importantly, they are often predictable and can be included in your news planning. 

Look at the story [Risk level of school buildings collapsing in England raised to ‘very likely’](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/dec/19/risk-of-england-school-buildings-collapse-very-likely-says-dfe) for an example of how to do it.
