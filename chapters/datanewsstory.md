# How to write a news story based on new data

## 1. Write a first par that establishes what the data says happened (or is happening), '...according to X'

Decide what your story is going to report about the data. A news story should focus on one of the following:

* A change is happening (numbers are going up or down)
* A place is the worst or best for something (ranking)
* The local area is ranked X for something (ranking)
* A certain number of events have happened, or a certain amount of money has been spent (scale)
* 'Wide variation' in something has been found

You can [find more on these angles in this post](https://onlinejournalismblog.com/2020/08/11/here-are-the-7-types-of-stories-most-often-found-in-data/)

The first line of your story should report this clearly, e.g. 

> The number of young women vaping every day in the UK more than tripled in the last year, according to government figures. ([source](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/sep/05/young-women-vaping-daily-uk-triples-ons))

Attribute who that is 'according to' *after* you have stated what's happened, not before (i.e. don't write "According to government figures, crime is up 10%"; write "Crime is up 10% according to new figures from the Government")

Avoid specific numbers in the first par: talk in broad terms and then fill in the details later...

## Add some context on when, who and where the data relates to

Having said 'what' is happening, and probably 'who', your second par should add further details not provided in the first par, such as:

* Who (more specifically): if you didn't name the source in the first par, give it in the second
* When: specify what period the data relates to
* Where: specify what geographical scope the data relates to
* What (more specifically): if your first par said something went up, or was ranked third worst, you can say what numbers it went from and to, or how close it was to the second ranked area, etc.
* How: you can also specify how the data was colleceted if it's important - although that can be covered in a later par if not

Here is the second par for the vaping story above:

> Data released by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed that one in 15 women (6.7%) aged 16-24 vaped daily in 2022 – up from fewer than one in 50 (1.9%) in 2021 – with young women overtaking their male counterparts for e-cigarette usage.

## 3. Add some facts about the events in question

Having summed up the story in the first two pars you can now shift your attention to the background that helps to put this new information into context. A little background research should help you establish how this confirms or changes what is already known, or how it relates to decisions or statements that have been made by those in power recently.

For example:

> The rise in young women vaping mirrors findings in an NHS survey of school-aged children last year, which showed more than one in five 15-year-old girls using e-cigarettes – hugely outstripping their male counterparts.

## 4. Add some quotes relating to the information (optional)

At this point you have enough to publish a simple brief news story. Indeed, you can publish what you have while you work on fleshing it out further.

The next ingredient you *could* (but don't have to) add is a quote. This will break up the sequence of facts that you've established, and maintain the reader's attention. 

Ideally this should be a quote from someone reacting to the new data. You could contact:

* Experts in the field, asking what the figures tell us, or why they're significant, or if there are flaws
* Politicians on both sides, who might argue that the figures support their policies, or defende their policies if they don't seem to be working
* Charities who operate in this field
* Senior figures in other organisations in the field

If you can't get a new quote, then you can introduce something that someone has said in any statements that came with the data release, or previous statements in relation to it. For example:

> NHS England’s chief executive, Amanda Pritchard, said in June that 40 children were admitted to hospital in England last year as a result of “vaping-related disorders”. These include lung damage and worsening asthma symptoms. This was up from 11 in 2021.

## 5. Add a secondary dimension to the story (optional)

You could identify another dimension to the data which gives your story a new lease of life - a new 'chapter'. For example, we could say that the data *also* reveals something else happening. 

Be careful with this, though - the secondary angle should be exactly that: secondary. It should take up much less space than the main angle, perhaps a few pars at most, and then it should end. To go on longer would risk it losing its focus and shape as a news article (it would become a feature and have to be rewritten in that vein). In the vaping example this is the secondary dimension:

> Meanwhile, the proportion of people smoking fell to its lowest level since comparable figures began. Just 11.2% of people aged 16 and over said they smoked, down from 12.7% last year – continuing a downward trend seen since at least 1974.

Note: for a shorter story, this secondary dimension can be the third or final paragraph in the story, instead of extra context or quotes. So that vaping story could be shortened to the following three paragraphs:

> The number of young women vaping every day in the UK more than tripled in the last year, according to government figures.
>
> Data released by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed that one in 15 women (6.7%) aged 16-24 vaped daily in 2022 – up from fewer than one in 50 (1.9%) in 2021 – with young women overtaking their male counterparts for e-cigarette usage.
>
> Meanwhile, the proportion of people smoking fell to its lowest level since comparable figures began. Just 11.2% of people aged 16 and over said they smoked, down from 12.7% last year – continuing a downward trend seen since at least 1974.

## 6. Add some information about what comes next

End the story by looking ahead to what happens next. It might be a forthcoming date for a debate, or a vote, or new data. It could be a statement (quote) that looks ahead. It could even be your secondary dimension that shifts the focus to other areas that need to be explored. For example:

> The Home Office said that any instance of hate crime was “one too many” and that it expected the police to “fully investigate” all such incidents and “make sure the cowards who commit them feel the full force of the law”.

## Write a headline based on your intro

Once the article is done, you can write your headline. This should repeat your intro, only in fewer words and in the present tense. The vaping story, for example, is headlined: 

> Number of young women vaping daily in the UK more than triples
