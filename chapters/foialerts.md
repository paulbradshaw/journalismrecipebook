# The refused FOI request (using alerts on WDTK)

Computer Weekly's [story on a refused FOI request](https://web.archive.org/web/20210331070201/https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252497573/Governments-refusal-of-freedom-of-information-request-about-Post-office-deeply-concerning) provides a useful example of one recipe for writing a story:

1. Set up alerts on WhatDoTheyKnow for an organisation of interest
2. Check those that are refused
3. Search WhatDoTheyKnow for similar requests that were granted in the past
4. If it seems that the request was refused unfairly, get a quote from an MP or similar powerful figure about the concerns over that
5. Seek a right of reply from the organisation about the concerns
6. Write up the story, with the new details alternating with background information 

## 1. Set up alerts on WhatDoTheyKnow for an organisation of interest

[WhatDoTheyKnow](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/) (WDTK) is a site that makes it easier to send Freedom of Information (FOI) requests - but you can also use it to monitor requests by others, and responses.

Create an account on the site and find the organisation that you want to monitor. In the example, reporter Karl Flinders is following the [Department for Business, Innovation and Skills](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/body/bis) (BEIS).

Click 'Follow' on that page to receive updates when new requests or responses appear on the site.

## 2. Check those that are refused

As you get alerted to new requests, some will be useful for stories generally - but those that are refused may be newsworthy too. Look out for those which a) seem to have been refused unfairly and b) relate to something important (newsworthy). In this example the reporter is clearly interested in the ongoing [Post Office IT scandal story](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-55271193).

Background reading on FOI will help. Matt Burgess's book [Freedom of Information: A Practical Guide for UK Journalists](https://www.routledge.com/Freedom-of-Information-A-Practical-Guide-for-UK-Journalists/Burgess/p/book/9781138793217) is [stocked in the library](https://capitadiscovery.co.uk/bcu/items/1220866), and recommended.

## 3. Search WhatDoTheyKnow for similar requests that were granted in the past

Thinking that a request was refused unfairly is one thing - but you'll need to *prove* that. One way to do so is to look for similar requests that were granted. (In the article example, the reporter found a previous request also looking for emails that was not refused despite asking for more).

You can use the **Keywords** box on the right of the organisation's page on WDTK to search *within* FOI requests to that organisation *only* (e.g. for "emails" or "correspondence").

Alternatively you can add your keywords at the end of the URL `https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/body/bis?utf8=%E2%9C%93&query=`, e.g.:

https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/body/bis?utf8=%E2%9C%93&query=email

## 4. If it seems that the request was refused unfairly, get a quote from an MP or similar powerful figure about the concerns over that

A refused FOI request alone isn't going to make the strongest story. A better **angle** of the story is going to be **concerns** over the refusal - and the person raising those concerns needs to be newsworthy or representative in some way, such as an MP, charity or union spokesperson or someone similar.

A useful tip is to look for people who already have an interest in the subject. The reporter here seeks a response MP Kevan Jones, for example, presumably because he [called for an inquiry](https://www.kevanjonesmp.org.uk/kevan-calls-for-public-inquiry-into-the-post-office-ltd-horizon-it-system/) into the Post Office IT scandal - so he already knows the issue and is likely to comment on it.

How do you find such a person? Try searching [TheyWorkForYou](https://www.theyworkforyou.com/), which allows you to search everything that's said in Parliament and other assemblies, for your keywords.

Try asking them concrete questions - not just what they think, but also what they think should be done, and whether they might do anything about it themselves. Look at the quotes in the article, such as this one, for ideas:

> Jones, Labour MP for North Durham and long-time campaigner for the subpostmasters affected, said the FOI request rejection was a cause for concern. “It is deeply concerning and frankly bizarre that the department has freely handed over the previous [correspondence], but is refusing to do the same for the latest on cost grounds,” he told Computer Weekly. “People will make up their own minds as to why the department is holding back these emails.”

## 5. Seek a right of reply from the organisation about the concerns

Finally, once you have some criticism you need to offer a right of reply from any organisations involved (this is a key element of journalistic objectivity and scepticism). 

In this case, the reporter sought a response from the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills. It looks like the body initially gave a generic response saying why the FOI response was refused rather than specifically addressing the question of why a similar request was granted. 

If this happens, reply specifically asking them to address that question (in this case they failed to do so and this is included in the article): "BEIS declined to answer, and a spokesperson said the department had nothing further to add."

Note that in writing up the article, the reporter does not use the words "I" but instead "Computer Weekly asked".

## 6. Write up the story, with the new details alternating with background information 

Now you have all the ingredients for your story - but you'll also need background information such as what happened before on this issue. See how and where the [article](https://web.archive.org/web/20210331070201/https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252497573/Governments-refusal-of-freedom-of-information-request-about-Post-office-deeply-concerning) brings in that background information, and where it uses the new info, for guidance.
