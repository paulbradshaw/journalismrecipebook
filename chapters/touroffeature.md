# How to: write a 'journey through' or 'tour of' feature

One format that you'll notice recurring every so often is the 'tour of' feature: this typically involves a journalist taking a tour of particular sites or locations that have something in common. That tour might take the form of a roadtrip or a pub crawl - the fundamental structure here is 'the journey'.

Examples include: 

* *[Next stop, Twatt! My tour of Britain’s fantastically filthy placenames](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/jan/21/next-stop-twatt-my-tour-of-britains-fantastically-filthy-placenames?utm_term=63cbd3c3844fcd243a00412125ce815d&utm_campaign=InsideSaturday&utm_source=esp&utm_medium=Email&CMP=insidesaturday_email)*
* *[Monopoly bored: Rosie Millard takes a themed bike tour of lockdown London](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/monopoly-bored-rosie-millard-takes-a-themed-bike-tour-of-lockdown-london-89jk5b8zv)*
* *[A brief tour of Britain’s least used stations](https://citymonitor.ai/transport/brief-tour-britain-s-least-used-stations-teesside-4156)*

## 1: Come up with a premise for the story

A good 'tour' feature has a clear premise: a reason why the reporter is spending so much time journeying through the sites in question, and a reason for selecting them. 

Often the spark is simple curiosity - but curiosity about what? And why? Write down what it is about these sites that interests you - this will often form part of the introduction to the story. For example:

> For the least used stations: "Where are these tiny stations? What purpose do they serve? And why should you definitely buy the first ticket out?"
> For the rude-sounding towns and villages: "What’s it like to live in them?"
> And for the Monopoly-based tour of London it's a holiday feature: "an innovative way to enjoy the capital’s landmarks with her family"

These questions could be different: for the stations feature they could have chosen to look at whether they could survive; for Monopoly sites it could be whether property prices reflect the board game itself. 

Once you've decided on a premise and the questions you'll use it to explore, that will shape everything else.

## 3: Conduct initial research, including interviews

Journalism is about rejection as much as selection, and the tour feature is a good example of this: it's unlikely your story will go to every site identified (a Monopoly feature with 32 sites is going to be boring by the end) so you'll need to research the potential sites in order to decide which ones you'll actually visit.

You'll also need to make the most of your trip, so you'll need to know in advance what to expect, where in particular to go, and who to speak to.

Your research should be focused on those things in particular:

* Which sites are the most interesting - and which ones are not? Which ones add something different? And which ones are similar to others?
* Where specifically could you go? (a village with a rude name has all sorts of different parts to it, for example)
* Who could you speak to? (What knowledge, experiences, expertise will you need to include? Who is interesting in that location?)

## 2: Identify a practical scope

Now you need to narrow down to a number of sites that you can practically cover. You need to decide how many - if any - you will physically visit, and whether you will cover any of the sites without having visited them. What's your budget - both in terms of time and money?

## 4: Plan and organise the 'trip', including interviews

I've put 'trip' in inverted commas for two reasons:

* You don't have to do it all in one go
* You don't have to physically visit all the places

Interviews will play a big role in dictating the timings of your visits: you'll want to organise your trip around the availability of your interviewees, so make sure to prioritise getting those organised and do that early on.

Your interviewees will often be a guide, too, so speak to them in advance for advice on when the best time would be to come, and where to go.

## 5: Write it up

The advantage of the 'tour' feature is that the structure of the piece should be relatively simple: it's a journey from point A to point Z, via a number of other points. Each new site will be a new section in your story, with a new subheading. 

This structure will *appear* chronological, too - although in truth you don't have to have visited the places in the order that you write about them. 

Try to order the places in a way that works best in terms of narrative structure. How much freedom you have here will depend on the premise: a journey through the sites on a Monopoly board, for example, would almost certainly need to follow the order of the board itself. But a journey through the UK's least used railway stations doesn't have to be from least to most used, or vice-versa (although you may want to end at the least used, as this is the obvious 'climax' of the story).

Start by identifying the places which would work best to end with, and to begin with. 

* A good ending often looks ahead, so that might be a place where things are planned or expected
* A good start raises questions, so look for places that do that early on
* A good middle answers those questions, so places that provide answers might work best in the middle of a story
