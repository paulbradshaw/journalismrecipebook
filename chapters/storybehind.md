# The 'story behind' article

A good basis for an article is to write the 'story behind' a newsworthy event. Sirin Kale's longform feature *[Out of thin air: the mystery of the man who fell from the sky](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/15/man-who-fell-from-the-sky-airplane-stowaway-kenya-london)* is a great example of the genre. And it also provides some useful pointers on how to plan and execute such a story.

Here are the steps:

1. Identify an event which justifies the 'story behind' approach
2. Identify key sources that you can interview
3. Identify any events that you could attend
4. Do background research
5. Structure the results

## 1. Identify an event which justifies the 'story behind' approach

The 'story behind' article is often written in the days following that event, but can also be written for a key anniversary (1 year, 5, 10, etc), or when that event becomes topical again (for example because there's an inquiry, protest, report, or other news event related to it). In some cases the story is compelling enough on its own that it doesn't matter when you publish it - it's 'timeless' (as in Kale's piece).

Pick an event which fits one of those criteria - the more newsworthy it was, the more likely it will be newsworthy to go 'behind' it.

## 2. Identify key sources that you can interview

Ideally you want someone 'on the ground' when the event happened. That might be witnesses, relatives and/or an organisation - in particular a specific person or team within that - that will have had to deal with. It's clear that Kale pursued this avenue, initially approaching the Metropolitan police’s missing person’s unit (which a "stowaway case would normally have been for"), but it sounds like they told her that "on the day the call came in, the team was swamped. So DS Paul Graves of the specialist crime unit volunteered". 

Graves is the core source for this story, and most of the narrative hangs on his 'quest' to find out the identity of the body.

Witnesses are also quoted in the story. Their quotes can come from reports at the time, but you might also find witnesses by speaking to journalists who interviewed them (if they're willing to share details, perhaps in exchange for useful leads you get as a result), by tracking them down based on their names, or by knocking on doors in an area.

Those key sources may provide ideas for other sources you might want to chase. For example, Graves's experiences in Kenya appear to have led Kale to speak to two Kenyan journalists who reported on the story and were able to pick up other threads of the story.

Finally, in researching the story it appears that Kale has come across the tale of someone who survived stowing away - and tracked that person down for interview. This provides a particularly unusual and rare perspective that really sets the story apart.

## 3. Identify any events that you could attend

The 'story' rarely ends with a major news event: further events are often triggered. Protests or demonstrations or inquiries or trials may be held. A death might be followed by a coroner's inquest, for example. All of these can be important in providing factual information for the story, in finding new sources and building contacts - but also in adding colour to the narrative.

In this case Kale attends the funeral of the person who died, allowing them to add a human dimension to the story that it might otherwise miss, and a resolution that helps lead the story to its ending.

## 4. Do background research

Large chunks of Kale's story are based entirely on background research, especially in the middle section: in one passage we read about the various people who have died at the beginning, middle and end of stowaway attempts. After that, we read about some research into those who survive. A later part relies on media reports about a possible identification which turned out to be false, and a third section quotes from an investigation into the airport. 

From that you can make a list of the types of background you should consider:
* Media reports of the event and similar events ([Nexis can be useful for this](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vRPWOlzvTlZ0r5wL333kH-YsGQTrUMoeEYRAuTc9NKF1ItKJGPdq22u2S7UtwbcQIJKsJAKVXnNUai2/pub))
* Academic research and researchers about an issue
* Official reports and similar documents

## 5. Structure the results

Kale's story follows a broadly chronological narrative, starting from the eyewitness account of the body falling, then the account of the police officer investigating, which it follows for the bulk of the article, before a brief section where Kenyan journalists' accounts pick up the tale, and finally the account of the funeral from the reporter herself.

Although the structure is broadly chronological, it strays from the chronology at some points. After the discovery of the body and Graves's initial involvement, we 'flashback' to a brief history of the issue. This acts as a bridge to the next section which takes place in Kenya. A second 'flashback' section provides the experience of someone who stowed away and survived, before the chronology is resumed back in Kenya. This movement in time helps keep the story moving when we can't move in space.

The final section also cuts backwards in time, albeit you might miss it, from an airport incident in 2021, to the funeral in 2020. But this works because the funeral is a natural ending - an opportunity for wider reflection and bringing the story back to the here and now: the final paragraphs focus on the numbers of people who have died on global migration routes to date.
