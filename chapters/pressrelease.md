# Writing a story from a press release

Press releases often don’t take much rewriting – the main things to do are:

 1. Make it your own by adding something new such as an original quote (either from the sender or another source) or chart
 2. Edit out any PR spin – press releases are ultimately designed to promote something, so you’ll find that you need to remove unsupported claims and spin etc. Also they will typically mention their client in the first or second par, so that would be demoted to much lower in the story.
 3. Chop it back to an appropriate length (press releases are often much longer than the story justifies)
