# How to write... a news story adapted from an interview feature or video

Quite often an interview *feature* will be adapted into a second story: an interview *news* article. While the feature might have a broader focus, such as a person's career or campaign, the news story will focus on the most newsworthy thing that the person said in the interview - and it will be shorter.

Interview news articles tend to happen in one of two ways: 

1. You've done an interview for a feature, and want to (or are asked to) make a second story out of it
   * Example: [this interview with actor Ruth Wilson](https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/may/06/ruth-wilson-interview-the-second-woman-luther-the-affair), and the [news story adapted from the interview](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/06/luther-actor-ruth-wilson-hits-out-at-hollywood-metoo-hypcrisy).
2. An interview has appeared elsewhere and you think there's a news angle on it that hasn't been done.
   * Example: [this GQ video interview with Ben Affleck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv8LLEmMu-M) was quickly [reported as a news story by The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/apr/18/ben-affleck-says-he-hated-horrendous-batman-suit-batsuit), [Entertainment Weekly](https://ew.com/batman-ben-affleck-says-batsuit-horrendous-sweaty-11717264), and [The Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/ben-affleck-batsuit-horrendous-to-wear-batman-1236194540/), among others.

The good news is that in either case, all the original reporting has already been done - either by you, or by someone else. All that needs to be done is to re-structure the material, and edit it down, to a different format and angle.

Writing a news story based on your own interview feature has the advantage of showcasing your adaptability - specifically your ability to take the same information and turn it into two different stories and story formats. Turning an existing interview into a news story shows your ability to spot a news 'hook' and write quickly (the news story has to be written within 24 hours of the interview being published, or it is no longer *news*).

The steps to do this are as follows:

1. Identify the most newsworthy thing said in the interview (the 'top line')
2. Add context - including the source
3. Bridge to further quotes by adding more context and paraphrasing
4. End by looking ahead to what comes next

## 1. Identify the 'top line' as use that for the headline and first paragraph

Look at the interview and decide what's the most newsworthy thing that's been said. This is often described as the 'top line' in a news story. Your headline is likely to be quote-driven, e.g. '"Y", says X" or 'X: "Y"'.

Three Affleck stories, for example, all go with the same top line, with slightly different phrasing: 

* *‘No thought given to the human being’: Ben Affleck says he hated his ‘horrendous’ Batman suit*
* *Former Batman Ben Affleck says the Batsuit was 'horrendous to wear': 'No thought put into the human being'*
* *Why Ben Affleck Says Batsuit Was “Horrendous to Wear” During His Tenure as Batman*

Note that this is very different to the video, which leads on the feature hook 'Making Ben Affleck Talk About Every Film He's Ever Done'. The mention of the Batsuit is not treated as especially important - it doesn't come until [14 minutes into the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv8LLEmMu-M&t=829s). In the Ruth Wilson interview the quote used for the news story is buried almost 3,000 words in!

The first line proper (excluding any 'second headline' or standfirst) of the story should repeat this, as the story does here. Normally the *role* of the person is given rather than their name (unless they're massively famous) and you might paraphrase the quote rather than give it in full:

> *Ben Affleck says that he “hated” the Batsuit, and that it was “horrendous to wear” and “made it difficult to make the movie”.*

Likewise in the actor piece:

> *The actor Ruth Wilson has hit out at the “hypocrisy” of Hollywood for its handling of the #MeToo revelations in [an interview with the Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/may/06/ruth-wilson-interview-the-second-woman-luther-the-affair).*

This is because the next paragraph(s) add the specifics.

## 2. Add context including the source

The second par of any news story tends to flesh out the first par with further details on the 5Ws (who, when, where, what, how, why) and any key context. Typically this often means the full quote, and where it was given (e.g. 'in an interview with X' or 'speaking to Y'). In the Affleck piece it's *where* the words were said, and *what* was said in more detail:

> *[Speaking to GQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv8LLEmMu-M&ab_channel=GQ), Affleck said that the main issue with the elaborate costume was the heat it generated. “They don’t breathe. They’re made to look the way they want them to look. There’s no thought put into the human being. So what happens is that you just start sweating … So in that thing, you’d just be pouring water, because you have that cowl over it. Like, there’s one thing to wear the suit, but once you cover your head, I guess that’s where all your heat kind of escapes and you feel it.”*

The Ruth Wilson news piece - having already given the source in the first par - explains *who* the person is (and by extension why she's newsworthy), along with a bit more of the quote.

> *Wilson, star of Luther, The Affair and His Dark Materials, said it was “extraordinary” to witness Hollywood shift from ignoring the abusive behaviour of leading industry figures such as the now jailed Harvey Weinstein to feigning interest.*

## 3. Bridge to further quotes by adding more context and paraphrasing

Once the 'who', 'where' and 'what' are established in that second par, further pars add further quotes, often using **paraphrasing** some quotes to bridge actual quotes, e.g. 

> *Affleck said that even highly trained stunt performers found it difficult to wear the suit for long periods. “They could do that for about like 45, 50 minutes and then they’re like gonna get heatstroke. So you had to come out of it.”*

The Ruth Wilson news piece also shifts to paraphrasing in the third par:

> *The 41-year-old also discussed the pressure on female actors to have cosmetic surgery, labelling treatments including Botox “mad”.*

Alongside paraphrasing, extra background research can be introduced to add further context:

> *Affleck’s Batsuit, designed by Oscar-nominated costume designer Michael Wilkinson and built by Jose Fernandez and Ironhead Studio, was reportedly made from multiple layers of Lycra and foam, taking Affleck around 25 minutes to get into it, with up to six costume assistants helping. In 2015, Wilkinson described the cowl as “incredible engineering”, saying that previous Batsuits had not allowed actors to turn their heads, and that the costume as designed was “comfortable and very flexible” and allow Affleck to perform in “a very natural and forceful way”.*

(One weakness of the Ruth Wilson news story is the lack of background details and reliance on quotes, which makes it less engaging.)

## 4. End by looking ahead to what comes next

The final par of a news story generally adds something that is happening next, or to take a quote with looks ahead in some way. The Ruth Wilson piece goes with:

> *“In 200 years, they’ll be looking back at images of women now going: ‘What were they doing? What is that? You’re blowing your face and lips up.’ Yet it’s a multibillion-dollar industry. And women are part of that industry, perpetuating this ‘empowerment’.”*

The Affleck story, on the other hand, looks back, which is less effective as an ending:

> *Affleck’s Batsuit is not the first to attract criticism, with the “nipple suit” George Clooney wore for Batman & Robin in 1997 often cited as one of the reasons for the film’s poor performance.*

## Spot the pattern
 
You can spot the pattern:

* Headline: Something has been said by someone (in that order: statement, then 'says X')
* 1st par: repeats same info from headline, with a few extra words
* 2nd par: full quote and source ('Speaking to the BBC, X said:')
* 3rd par: background or further quote but partly paraphrased ('X said that he also felt Y. "Quotey quote"')
* Further pars: background context breaks up further quotes
