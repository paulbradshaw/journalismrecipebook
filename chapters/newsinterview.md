# How to write... a news story adapted from an interview feature or video

Quite often an interview *feature* will be adapted into a second story: an interview *news* article. While the feature might have a broader focus, such as a person's career or campaign, the news story will focus on the most newsworthy thing that the person said in the interview - and it will be shorter.

Interview news articles tend to happen in one of two ways: 

1. You've done an interview for a feature, and want to (or are asked to) make a second story out of it; or
2. An interview has appeared elsewhere and you think there's a news angle on it that hasn't been done. For example, [this GQ video interview with Ben Affleck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv8LLEmMu-M) was quickly [reproted as a news story by The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/apr/18/ben-affleck-says-he-hated-horrendous-batman-suit-batsuit), [Entertainment Weekly](https://ew.com/batman-ben-affleck-says-batsuit-horrendous-sweaty-11717264), and [The Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/ben-affleck-batsuit-horrendous-to-wear-batman-1236194540/), among others.

The mention of the Batsuit doesn't come until [14 minutes into the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv8LLEmMu-M&t=829s)
