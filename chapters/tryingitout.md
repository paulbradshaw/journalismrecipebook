# How to write: a "trying it out" feature

If a particular activity is in the news (topical), you or an editor might pitch/propose doing a first person feature where the journalist tries out that activity. 

One example is Zoe Williams's *[Grappling with Zuckerberg: why do bros go mad for Brazilian jiu-jitsu?](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/may/12/grappling-with-zuckerberg-why-do-bros-go-mad-for-brazilian-jiu-jitsu)* (the print headline was *Brazilian jiu-jitsu: getting ripped and keeping up with the tech bros*).

Here's how to write it:

1. Identify an activity that's in the news (it could be a trend, or something a famous person has said/admitted they do)
2. Pitch the story (will readers of the target publication care?)
3. Conduct background research, including any interviews
4. Organise the activity, including ensuring the presence of any key people
5. Do the activity, taking photos, notes, and video/audio if needed
6. Write up a first draft
7. Edit
8. Rewrite, edit again, and publish!

## 1. Identify an activity that's in the news (it could be a trend, or something a famous person has said/admitted they do)

The topicality is key here: the feature should justify in the first par or two why the journalist is being given the time to indulge in this practice. In Williams's feature, that comes in par 2 of the article: 

> Most recently, Mark Zuckerberg revealed on his social media accounts this week that [he had won gold and silver in a tournament(https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/may/08/mark-zuckerberg-tom-hardy-list-celebrity-brazilian-jiu-jitsu-fighters). He joins various actors who may have confused themselves with their roles: Henry Cavill, who played Superman, Tom Hardy, of Mad Max: Fury Road fame, and Guy Ritchie, the director of King Arthur: Legend of the Sword. Russell Brand also enjoys the martial art, always at the front of the queue whenever anything fashionable and ostentatiously muscular – either physically or politically – is in the offing.

## 2. Pitch the story (will readers of the target publication care?)

The topicality should form part of your pitch - "Zuckerberg is making a big thing about jiu-jitsu, why don't we do a feature where a journalist tries it out?" - but also make sure it's relevant to your audience (do they care about this person? Will they have read the stories?) and explain why you should be the person to do it (you might have experience/contacts in the field; you might be someone who can write well).

## 3. Conduct background research, including any interviews

Don't just go ahead and do the activity - you want to make the most of the limited time you will have, so spend some time doing background research on the activity, thinking in particular about:

* What locations might be best to do it?
* Which people are important in this field, or interesting/colourful, who you could speak to or quote second hand?
* What history might be part of this article/your questions? (e.g. have other famous people talked about this? How did it all begin?)

You can conduct some interviews ahead of the activity - or even organise for the interviewee to come along and be part of it so you can speak to them at the same time (you might choose a location based on a person who will be there, for example).

You can also begin to write the article - the first few pars will be about the topical hook and background to it.

## 4. Organise the activity, including ensuring the presence of any key people

Now you're ready to organise the activity based on that background research. Think about what you'll need to do to make it as informative and colourful as possible. Do you need some 'jeopardy'? Competition/conflict?

## 5. Do the activity, taking photos, notes, and video/audio if needed

When you do the activity, don't forget to take photos and video/audio so you have as much material as possible - whether that's going to be published, or just help you remember details. Take notes, too.

## 6. Write up a first draft

A good basic structure for this feature looks like this:

* Intro: establish the topical hook that justifies this story
* Pars 2-3: background
* 'Set the scene': introduce us to the location or a person within that - you might also start with the journey there if that's important/relevant
* Weave in further background to break up the article
* Continue to tell the story of what happens - this is likely to be a largely chronological structure
* Repeat this process of alternating between background and the experience itself - quotes and people are key to keep things interesting. The reader can only listen to you for so long, and if you're not talking to people that makes you look quite antisocial/egotistical!
* Ending: as always, this is likely to look ahead, so you might end on what comes next for the people involved in this activity (for example how are they hoping to build on this publicity?) or for an individual who's been introduced (what are they hoping to achieve next) or you might talk about your own feelings about whether you'll do it again (less interesting!). You can use a 'circular' ending where you return to a problem introduced earlier, e.g. someone is struggling with a challenge and you say "That person? She never worked it out" (or words to that effect).

## 7. Edit

Always edit your first draft - look out for 'warming up' at the start (cut it out) and 'essay conclusions' at the end (although this is one of the rare formats where conclusions can be OK).

If you're not chopping anything out, then you're not being ruthless enough! For each paragraph ask if the story still makes sense without it - if it does, then it can probably go. Look for using two words when one will do, or a long word when a short one is simpler and clearer, etc.

Leave the headline until this stage.

## 8. Rewrite, edit again, and publish!

Continue to redraft and write until it's ready to publish. Don't forget to write social media versions of it, too (not just repeat the headline).
