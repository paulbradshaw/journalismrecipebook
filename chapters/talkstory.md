# How to write a story based on a talk

Writing a story based on a talk is very similar to [writing a story based on a panel event](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/journalismrecipebook/blob/main/chapters/eventreport.md), so follow the instructions there.

One example to follow is [Birmingham accent ranked ‘most hated’ on BBC’s unofficial league table, Kate Adie reveals](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/apr/12/birmingham-accent-ranked-most-hated-bbc-unofficial-league-table-kate-adie). This is a story based on Kate Adie "speaking at an event marking the cataloguing of a huge archive of material documenting her life and career".

The reporter has identified the most newsworthy thing that Adie 'reveals' during that talk, and creates a news story focusing on that angle.

This is the key approach to bear in mind when attending an event and looking to write a news story out of it (or being alert to one): what does someone say that reveals something new?

You need to check that this hasn't been revealed before (it's not news), but it can still be newsworthy even if it happened years ago, because it's only being revealed now.
