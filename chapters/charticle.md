# How to write: a charticle

A **charticle** is a genre of feature similar to the [listicle](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/journalismrecipebook/blob/main/chapters/listicles.md) (in fact, you could say the charticle is a sub-genre of the listicle). Like the listicle, it is an article in the form of a list - but the charticle is also a *list of charts*.

Charticles also normally have a number in the headline, and focus on 'essential' information on a topical issue, e.g. [This year’s A-level results in England explained in five charts](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/aug/18/england-a-level-result-explained-five-charts) or [Net zero by 2050: 9 charts showing the world's progress](https://www.dw.com/en/net-zero-by-2050-9-charts-showing-the-worlds-progress/a-59684637) or [12 Charts Showing The Inequality Challenge Facing Theresa May](https://www.buzzfeed.com/jamesball/13-charts-showing-the-inequality-challenge-facing-theresa-ma). 

The steps to making a charticle are also similar to listicles, but steps 2 and 5 are slightly different:

1. Identify the topic you are going to write about
2. Find data on the topic
3. Select the data angles that are going to make up the items in your charticle
4. Write the text of the listicle
5. Add a chart for each item
6. Edit the draft
7. Publish!

## 1. Identify the topic you are going to write about

Charticles don't tend to have original quotes, or even reveal new facts - so what is its purpose? The selling point of a charticle is that it's going to give us some **key facts in a short amount of time**. 

That means that the topic needs to be newsworthy enough for us to want that quick overview. Typically, the topic will be something that is on the news agenda because of something that has happened in the news. In [This year’s A-level results in England explained in five charts](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/aug/18/england-a-level-result-explained-five-charts) that is simply the release of those results. In [12 Charts Showing The Inequality Challenge Facing Theresa May](https://www.buzzfeed.com/jamesball/13-charts-showing-the-inequality-challenge-facing-theresa-ma) it's a pledge by the then-Prime Minister in a speech. In [Net zero by 2050: 9 charts showing the world's progress](https://www.dw.com/en/net-zero-by-2050-9-charts-showing-the-worlds-progress/a-59684637) it's an issue which is almost always on the news agenda: efforts to tackle climate change. 

Try to brainstorm more than one idea before identifying the strongest one.

## 2. Find data on the topic

A listicle only needs background research on the topic - but a charticle needs data. Because you can't make charts without it.

You can do a charticle with a single dataset, if there's enough detail in it, or different sheets covering different measures.

But many charticles draw on more than one dataset. 

Make a list of all the datasets you can find, and brainstorm what stories they can tell (the charts). The most common stories are [scale, change, and ranking](https://onlinejournalismblog.com/2020/08/11/here-are-the-7-types-of-stories-most-often-found-in-data/) so try to brainstorm stories/charts along those lines. For example, pie charts can show the scale of something (how big a proportion it makes up), and bar charts can show the top or bottom 10 ranking places, categories, or organisations. A line chart can show how something has changed over the last five or 10 years. 

Don't make it complicated: keep it simple, because you don't want it to take too much time, and the chart should be instantly understandable.

Once you've brainstormed at least 10 ideas, start to shortlist the best ones.
