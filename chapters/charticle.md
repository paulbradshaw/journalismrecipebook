# How to write: a charticle

A **charticle** is a genre of feature similar to the [listicle](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/journalismrecipebook/blob/main/chapters/listicles.md) (in fact, you could say the charticle is a sub-genre of the listicle). Like the listicle, it is an article in the form of a list - but the charticle is also a *list of charts*.

Charticles also normally have a number in the headline, and focus on 'essential' information on a topical issue, e.g. [This year’s A-level results in England explained in five charts](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/aug/18/england-a-level-result-explained-five-charts) or [Net zero by 2050: 9 charts showing the world's progress](https://www.dw.com/en/net-zero-by-2050-9-charts-showing-the-worlds-progress/a-59684637) or [12 Charts Showing The Inequality Challenge Facing Theresa May](https://www.buzzfeed.com/jamesball/13-charts-showing-the-inequality-challenge-facing-theresa-ma). 

The steps to making a charticle are also similar to listicles, but steps 2 and 5 are slightly different:

1. Identify the topic you are going to write about
2. Find data on the topic
3. Select and make the charts that are going to make up the items in your charticle
4. Write the text of the listicle
5. Edit the draft
6. Publish!

## 1. Identify the topic you are going to write about

Charticles don't tend to have original quotes, or even reveal new facts - so what is its purpose? The selling point of a charticle is that it's going to give us some **key facts in a short amount of time**. 

That means that the topic needs to be newsworthy enough for us to want that quick overview. Typically, the topic will be something that is on the news agenda because of something that has happened in the news. In [This year’s A-level results in England explained in five charts](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/aug/18/england-a-level-result-explained-five-charts) that is simply the release of those results. In [12 Charts Showing The Inequality Challenge Facing Theresa May](https://www.buzzfeed.com/jamesball/13-charts-showing-the-inequality-challenge-facing-theresa-ma) it's a pledge by the then-Prime Minister in a speech. In [Net zero by 2050: 9 charts showing the world's progress](https://www.dw.com/en/net-zero-by-2050-9-charts-showing-the-worlds-progress/a-59684637) it's an issue which is almost always on the news agenda: efforts to tackle climate change. 

Try to brainstorm more than one idea before identifying the strongest one.

## 2. Find data on the topic

A listicle only needs background research on the topic - but a charticle needs data. Because you can't make charts without data.

You can create a list of charts from a single dataset, if there's enough detail in it. But many charticles draw on more than one dataset. 

Make a list of all the datasets you can find, and brainstorm what stories they can tell (the charts). The most common stories are [scale, change, and ranking](https://onlinejournalismblog.com/2020/08/11/here-are-the-7-types-of-stories-most-often-found-in-data/) so try to brainstorm lists of charts along those lines. 

For example, pie charts can show the scale of something (how big a proportion it makes up), and bar charts can show the top or bottom 10 ranking places, categories, or organisations. A line chart can show how something has changed over the last five or 10 years. 

Don't make the ideas on your list complicated: keep it simple, because you don't want it to take too much time, and the chart should be instantly understandable.

## 3. Select and make (or find) the charts that are going to make up the items in your charticle

Once you've brainstormed at least 10 ideas, start to shortlist the best ones. 

Aim for at least six charts in your story: less than that and it feels like it hasn't been properly researched, or doesn't justify the listicle format.

If you haven't got enough data for six items, *do some more research* - or ditch the story entirely as not justifying a charticle.

You'll need the skills to make the charts using a tool like Datawrapper or Flourish. There are lots of video tutorials on how to create charts with these platforms, and book chapters and tutorials across the web. 

## 4. Write the text of the charticle

The charticle structure is similar to the listicle:

* A headline 
* An intro 
* A subheading telling the story for each chart
* One to three sentences of explanation for each chart - basically a News In Brief (NIB)

The **headline** should contain a number and a 'sell' or 'call to action', and indicate the selling point that the story is 'in charts'. Common patterns include 'X charts showing Y' or 'In charts: seven reasons why X' or 'X explained in six charts' or 'Here are nine charts that tell you everything you need to know about Y'

The **intro** should establish the topical reason for the listicle, e.g. *As political leaders meet to agree targets for action on global warming, here are the nine charts that show why this is the most important meeting of the year.*

The **charts** should be ordered with some thought about narrative structure and ways that elements might be juxtaposed against each other: for example, you might start with a chart that shows the scale of a problem, and follow it with a chart that puts it into the context of recent history (is it going up or down), then a chart which looks at the places most affected (or which rank worst), and then a chart which focuses solely on one of those places, and so on.

The **sections** should be written like mini [news stories](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/journalismrecipebook/blob/main/chapters/datanewsstory.md): 

* The first par of the section tells you the story in general terms
* The second par adds specific numbers and names/places
* The third par might add a secondary angle (such as whether the number is higher or lower than it was before) or context (such as a quote)

Look at the linked examples to see how they repeat this pattern.

## 5. Edit the draft

Once you've completed your draft, make sure you edit it. 

* Check spelling and grammar - especially in subheadings where it's easiest to miss typos. Make sure every name is correctly spelt, too.
* Check that every claim is attributed
* Check you've linked to sources
* Check that every word has earned its place - it's common to overwrite your first draft, so look to cut words and whole sentences out in your second.

Once you've completed a second edit, look at it again - a good article is edited multiple times.

## 7. Publish!

Once it's ready to go, publish the piece and share on social media. 

Note: an alternative to the charticle is the 'in numbers' listicle: you can [find a guide to writing that here](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/journalismrecipebook/blob/main/chapters/bythenumbers.md)
