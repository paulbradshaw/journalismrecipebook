# How to: write a 'by the numbers' story

One common follow-up done in response to a news story, is a 'by the numbers' feature.

This is in some ways a form of [explainer](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/journalismrecipebook/blob/main/explainer.md). Its objective is to help readers understand a current news event by putting it into the context of key facts - numbers - related to it.

Here are some examples of news events and 'by the numbers' features that could be done in response:

* Event: Emma Hayes is appointed as the coach of the US women's football team.

Feature: *Emma Hayes's career in numbers*: 'As Emma Hayes prepares to take control of the US national team, we look at how successful the Chelsea manager has been over the past decade'

* Event: Premier League signs a new TV deal

Feature: *Premier League TV deals - in numbers*: 'As the Premier League signs an £Xm deal for the rights to stream games for the next four years, we look at how the latest agreement compares to previous deals'

* Event: Player signs a big money deal/contract (or rumours suggest they will)

Feature: *Is Player X really worth £Ym? Here's what the data says*: 'As Player X prepares to join Y in the biggest deal of the year, we look at the stats that persuaded manager Z to break the bank to sign her'

In each case the feature needs to be done within a reasonable timescale while the news event is still recent. However, you can also plan ahead: with something like an announcement, you can plan your story for when the announced event comes to pass, e.g. Emma Hayes announcing her move is one event, but you can also run a story about her numbers when she takes up the position. A player signing for a club is one event, but their debut would be another excuse to run the same story.
