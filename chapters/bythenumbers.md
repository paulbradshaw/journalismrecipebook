# How to: write a 'by the numbers' story

One common follow-up done in response to a news story, is a 'by the numbers' feature.

This is in some ways a form of [explainer](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/journalismrecipebook/blob/main/explainer.md). Its objective is to help readers understand a current news event by putting it into the context of key facts - numbers - related to it.

Here's how to write it:

1. Identify an event which might justify a 'by the numbers' treatment - anything involving measurable things (money, success, performance) could work
2. Brainstorm what qualities related to the event/person/organisation might be measured somewhere - and narrow to a list of those best for the story
3. Research a range of sources to find key figures
4. Enter them in a spreadsheet
5. Generate charts based on the spreadsheet
6. Write up the story


## 1. Identify an event which might justify a 'by the numbers' treatment - anything involving measurable things (money, success, performance) could work

Here are some examples of news events and 'by the numbers' features that could be done in response:

* Event: Emma Hayes is appointed as the coach of the US women's football team.

Feature: *Emma Hayes's career in numbers*: 'As Emma Hayes prepares to take control of the US national team, we look at how successful the Chelsea manager has been over the past decade'

* Event: Premier League signs a new TV deal

Feature: *Premier League TV deals - in numbers*: 'As the Premier League signs an £Xm deal for the rights to stream games for the next four years, we look at how the latest agreement compares to previous deals'

* Event: Player signs a big money deal/contract (or rumours suggest they will)

Feature: *Is Player X really worth £Ym? Here's what the data says*: 'As Player X prepares to join Y in the biggest deal of the year, we look at the stats that persuaded manager Z to break the bank to sign her'

In all three examples we can identify **measurable things**: career success, money, performance, and so on (more on this below).

In each case the feature needs to be done within a reasonable timescale while the news event is still recent. However, you can also plan ahead: with something like an announcement, you can plan your story for when the announced event comes to pass, e.g. Emma Hayes announcing her move is one event, but you can also run a story about her numbers when she takes up the position. A player signing for a club is one event, but their debut would be another excuse to run the same story.

## 2. Brainstorm what qualities related to the event/person/organisation might be measured somewhere - and narrow to a list of those best for the story

Spend a bit of time thinking about different dimensions of the person, event, organisation etc. - not just the obvious stuff.

Emma Hayes's career, for example, can be measured in terms of trophies won, yes - but also games won, drawn and lost; accolades accumulated; and so on. 

TV deals can be measured in their value, yes - but also the numbers of games involved; the numbers of bidders; and so on.

A player's signing can be measured in comparison to other big signings; their goals, completed passes, miles covered; and so on. 

Once you've spent some time brainstorming, narrow down to the most interesting ones. You want a story which tells us the key facts but also some surprising ones too.

## 3. Research a range of sources to find key figures

The facts for your story are already out there - but the key thing is that it's not out there *as data*, i.e. a structured table of data that can be visualised, ranked, sorted etc.

So for the TV deal there will be various text news reports about each deal, how much it was worth, how many games, bidders, etc. 

As you find each source, you need to convert that textual (unstructured) data into structured data: a table.

## 4. Enter them in a spreadsheet

Create a spreadsheet to store your figures. A flexible design is to have the following columns:

* A column for time: it might be 'year' (for TV deals) or 'date' (for individual games) or some other dimension. You could have more than one column for time, e.g. one for year, one for month, and one for day of the month.
* A 'measure' column: this should only contain textual data, e.g. it might have 'trophy' in each cell, or 'pass completion' or 'games in deal'
* A 'value' column: this should ONLY contain numerical data, and it's where you would specify the number of trophies, the pass completion percentage, or number of games in a deal
* A 'source' column: this is where you need to paste the URL of the page where you got the figure from, so that your sources can be checked and followed up on
* A 'notes' column: use this to add any notes with extra info, e.g. that a prize was shared with someone else. This helps ensure that the other cells are kept consistent.

The goal here is to have something which can then be visualised...

## 5. Generate charts based on the spreadsheet

Once you have all the data that you need, you can generate charts and analysis for your story. Examples might include:

* A line chart showing the increasing value of TV deals
* A pie chart showing the composition of the current TV deal (e.g. how many games each bidder got)
* A bar chart comparing this player's price or performance stats with others
* A scatterplot comparing this manager's performance with others in the league (tricky! Use annotation to help it tell a story)

## 6. Write up the story

Those charts will then form the spine of the story. Here's how to write it up:

**Headline**: some examples of headlines are given above - you'll notice a common pattern is to state the event, followed by '- in numbers', e.g. 'The housing crisis - in numbers'. Another pattern is to start with 'The numbers behind', e.g. 'The numbers behind the housing crisis'. A third approach is 'Here's what we know about', e.g. 'Here's what we know about Bolton's record-breaking signing'. A fourth approach is the listicle: '5 things we know about X' or the charticle: 'These 5 charts tell you everything you need to know about stop and search'

**Standfirst**: because this is a feature, it needs a paragraph between the headline and the story proper, called a standfirst. This establishes the **topical hook** and what the article will do about it. We had some examples above: *'As Player X prepares to join Y in the biggest deal of the year, we look at the stats that persuaded manager Z to break the bank to sign her'*. Notice the pattern here is to write a two-part sentence (or two sentences): first, introduce the current news event ('As X') that justifies this feature; and second, explain what this article will do ('we do Y'). The 'we' in the article is often replace with the brand, e.g. 'As the government announces new funding for the NHS, Birmingham Eastside looks at the numbers that are making ministers worried'. It can also be replaced with your name, e.g. 'As the government announces new funding for the NHS, Paul Bradshaw looks at the numbers that are making ministers worried'. That's allowed because this is separate to *your article* which comes after it.

**First par**: The story now begins, so make sure you write the first paragraph as if the headline and standfirst don't exist. Here you can explain the background - the series of events leading up to this point - but don't spend too long on it (no more than three pars) before getting into the first point.

**First point**: Your first point is an observation of something about the data: it might be about change (TV deals have increased by 130% in ten years) or comparison (this manager is twice as successful as any other) or scale (there are X number of people homeless). Insert a subheading for that point as if it's a mini news story, then a chart, and a few pars telling the story of that change - it might be just one par. Don't write too much. You can include quotes, as long as they're attributed.

**Other points**: Repeat this pattern for each subsequent point - you can structure your article as a series of 5 or so points.

**Ending**: End by telling us what happens next (when does the manager take up her new role) or where the reader can find out more.
