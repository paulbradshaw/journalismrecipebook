# Writing a 'mapped' or 'explore' story

A story format used regularly in data journalism is the 'mapped' story. This is where the journalist takes some data and plots it on a map for users to explore. Examples include *[The UK’s crime hotspots MAPPED — how safe is your area?](https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/1752976/local-crime-rates-map-spt)* and *[Food outlets: all the hygiene ratings where you live](https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2013/jul/26/food-outlets-hygiene-ratings-datablog)* (Note: the maps often no longer work in older stories, but the links should allow you to get an idea of how the stories were structured).

These stories lead on the 'new thing' of the map itself being created (in a similar way to how stories might lead on 'new photos' or 'new video' being released).

They can also be very short: just one paragraph is enough to establish the news hook before inviting the reader to interact with the map.

Here's how to write it.

## 1. Create the map

You'll [find some workshops on how to create interactive maps here](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/MED7373-Data-Journalism/tree/master/mapping), including datasets. Data on crimes, stop and search, and food hygiene reports are all regular sources of data that can be used for this. 

## 2. Write the intro

Once the map is done, write an opening paragraph to establish what the story is, and what the reader is supposed to do. Here's how The Express wrote their intro:

> Overall crime is going down in England and Wales, but the victims of certain crimes and the residents of certain areas could hardly be convinced this is the case. Across the board, the only trend firmly distinguishable is the higher proportion of perpetrators getting off scot-free. Check Express.co.uk’s map below to see how bad crime is in your area.

It's not a very good intro, but it does the job (you can do it even better). The key thing is to highlight the two parts of the intro:

1. Establish what's happening (the topical context)
2. Give the user a 'call to action' inviting them to interact with the map in some way

Here's a better example:

> As [police are given new powers to stop and search people](https://www.libertyhumanrights.org.uk/advice_information/public-order-act-new-stop-search-powers/), Birmingham Eastside has compiled data on every stop and search in the West Midlands last month. Explore the interactive map to see where people have been stopped and searched near you.

This leads on a new announcement which makes the map *topical*. It also emphasises the *exclusivity* of the map. Note that when you've made something yourself, you don't write "I have": instead you write in the third person as the brand "Birmingham Eastside has". This helps the story avoid appearing subjective or indulgent.

Here's another example:

> Last year [35 restaurants failed food hygiene inspections](#). Explore the interactive map to see how your local restaurant did.

## 3. Write any other paragraphs (optional)

## 4. Write the headline

## 5. Publish!
