# Writing a 'mapped' or 'explore' story

A story format used regularly in data journalism is the 'mapped' story. This is where the journalist takes some data and plots it on a map for users to explore. Examples include *[The UK’s crime hotspots MAPPED — how safe is your area?](https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/1752976/local-crime-rates-map-spt)* and *[Food outlets: all the hygiene ratings where you live](https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2013/jul/26/food-outlets-hygiene-ratings-datablog)* (Note: the maps often no longer work in older stories, but the links should allow you to get an idea of how the stories were structured).

These stories lead on the 'new thing' of the map itself being created (in a similar way to how stories might lead on 'new photos' or 'new video' being released).

They can also be very short: just one paragraph is enough to establish the news hook before inviting the reader to interact with the map.

Here's how to write it.

## 1. Create the map

You'll [find some workshops on how to create interactive maps here](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/MED7373-Data-Journalism/tree/master/mapping), including datasets. Data on crimes, stop and search, and food hygiene reports are all regular sources of data that can be used for this. 

## 2. Write the intro

Once the map is done, write an opening paragraph to establish what the story is, and what the reader is supposed to do. Here's how The Express wrote their intro:

> Overall crime is going down in England and Wales, but the victims of certain crimes and the residents of certain areas could hardly be convinced this is the case. Across the board, the only trend firmly distinguishable is the higher proportion of perpetrators getting off scot-free. Check Express.co.uk’s map below to see how bad crime is in your area.

It's not a very good intro, but it does the job (you can do it even better). The key thing is to highlight the two parts of the intro:

1. Establish what's happening (the topical context)
2. Give the user a 'call to action' inviting them to interact with the map in some way

Here's a better example:

> As [police are given new powers to stop and search people](https://www.libertyhumanrights.org.uk/advice_information/public-order-act-new-stop-search-powers/), Birmingham Eastside has compiled data on every stop and search in the West Midlands last month. Explore the interactive map to see where people have been stopped and searched near you.

This leads on a new announcement which makes the map *topical*. It also emphasises the *exclusivity* of the map. Note that when you've made something yourself, you don't write "I have": instead you write in the third person as the brand "Birmingham Eastside has". This helps the story avoid appearing subjective or indulgent.

Here's another example:

> Last year [35 restaurants failed food hygiene inspections](#). Explore the interactive map to see how your local restaurant did.

In this last case, you (or a colleague) has written a news story about how many restaurants have failed food hygiene inspections, and this interactive feature 'leads off' that story by providing extra depth. (The news story should link to this too at the end, driving traffic in both directions).

## 3. Embed the map - or a linked screenshot

You can now embed the map underneath that paragraph. You should be able to get the embed code from the site you used to create the map. For more help on embedding, search Google for help on the particular platforms you're using to embed from (i.e. Datawrapper or Flourish) and to (e.g. Medium or WordPress etc.). For example, here is a guide to [how to embed visualizations in Medium articles](https://academy.datawrapper.de/article/202-how-to-embed-charts-in-medium-articles) and one on [embedding with Flourish](https://help.flourish.studio/article/15-share-or-embed-a-flourish-visualization).

On Birmingham Eastside you can use the embed code but you will need to have certain permissions to use it. Contact Paul Bradshaw for help in using embed code on the site.

If you cannot embed the map (WordPress.com, for example, does not allow you to use embed code), then: 

* Take a screenshot of the map
* Embed it in the article like any other image
* Link the image to the live version hosted on Datawrapper or Flourish (when you publish your map on those sites, they will give you a direct link to it).
* Don't forget to add an alternative description to the image describing what it shows
* Add a caption inviting the reader to click on the image to visit the interactive version. The caption can include linked text too.
* Edit your intro text so that the 'call to action' does the same, with a link there too

## 4. Write any other paragraphs (optional)

That intro par is enough on its own - but if you feel like the article justifies it, you can flesh out your interactive map feature by adding further pars with extra context. 

[For example](https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/whats-on/food-drink-news/filthy-zero-star-hygiene-restaurants-27752327):

>  According to the interactive map, there are dozens of establishments with zero food hygiene ratings dotted across the city - and many more with one and two stars which require improvement. All the premises listed below were shown on the Food Standards Agency as having a zero rating as of September 20, 2023. [this paragraph is followed by a bullet list of restaurants with low ratings]

Or, [as in this example](https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2013/jul/26/food-outlets-hygiene-ratings-datablog): 

> Craigavon in Northern Ireland is the only local authority where 100% of food inspections resulted in a pass.
>
> By contrast, Sutton and Bexley fall well short of the national average 91% pass rate – scoring just 68% and 66% respectively. You can also use our interactive map to spot regional trends. It shows that the biggest concentration of unhygienic food outlets is to be found in London.

## 5. Write the headline

It's always easier to write the headline last. This essentially repeats the intro - but in a feature like this, you have a few different options. One option is to focus on the fact that something has been mapped. For example:

> Mapped: every crime in your area
>
> Bike theft in Greater Manchester: every crime mapped

A second option is to focus on the call to action

> Which restaurants failed hygiene inspections in your area? Find out with this interactive map
>
> Explore crime in your area with this interactive map

A third option is to use the 'Here is/are' formulation:

> Here are the restaurants getting top ratings in your area
>
> Here are the places where police stopped and searched people last month

## 5. Publish!

These articles shouldn't take too long - especially if you use a paragraph-and-map approach. Once you're ready, click publish and start talking about the story on social media. Remember you can tell a different story there, too - you can write a thread about the data, and then point to the map at the end, or tell a story about some of the most interesting points on the map.
