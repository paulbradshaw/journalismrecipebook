# Writing a 'mapped' or 'explore' story

A story format used regularly in data journalism is the 'mapped' story. This is where the journalist takes some data and plots it on a map for users to explore. Examples include *[The UK’s crime hotspots MAPPED — how safe is your area?](https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/1752976/local-crime-rates-map-spt)* and *[Food outlets: all the hygiene ratings where you live](https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2013/jul/26/food-outlets-hygiene-ratings-datablog)* (Note: the maps often no longer work in older stories, but the links should allow you to get an idea of how the stories were structured).

These stories lead on the 'new thing' of the map itself being created (in a similar way to how stories might lead on 'new photos' or 'new video' being released).

They can also be very short: just one paragraph is enough to establish the news hook before inviting the reader to interact with the map.

Here's how to write it.
