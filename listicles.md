# How to write a listicle

A **listicle** is an article in the form of a list (the term 'listicle' is a [portmanteau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portmanteau) of the words 'list' and 'article'). 

Listicles normally have a number in the headline, and focus on 'essential' information on a topical issue, e.g. [10 Things You Need To Know About The #GamerGate Scanda](https://whatculture.com/gaming/10-things-need-know-gamergate-scandal). The format can also be used for more identity-based features, e.g. [22 Types Of Customers Every Bartender Hates](http://crazycheshirehatter.blogspot.co.uk/2016/03/22-types-of-customers-every-bartender.html).

The steps to making a listicle are:

1. Identify the topic you are going to write about
2. Research the topic
3. Select the pieces of information that are going to make up the items in your listicle
4. Write the text of the listicle
5. Add illustration for each item
6. Edit the draft
7. Publish!


## 1. Identify the topic you are going to write about

Because a listicle isn't telling the reader anything *new*, there needs to be a reason why it's worth reading - and why an editor would allow you to spend time on it (or commmission it). 

Topics can range from the frivolous and humorous (“11 Random, Amazing Food Videos We Can't Stop Playing On Repeat”) to the serious (“12 Charts That Explain Why You’ll Never, Ever Be Able To Afford A Home”; “16 Absolutely Outrageous Abuses Detailed in the CIA Torture Report”). They work particularly well as a form of curation, rounding up the best or most important information about an issue or event.

The three main reasons are:
* A news event has happened where readers will need to catch up on the background, or find out about the wider issue (an explainer listicle)
* A 'top ten' (but probably not ten)
* Entertaining readers with a roundup of qualities that they can recognise in themselves (an identity listicle)

Decide why you're writing your listicle - the simplest approach is to pick a topical issue that needs explaining - and what the topic is. Try to brainstorm more than one idea before identifying the strongest one.

## 2. Research the topic

In order to explain a topic to someone else you'll need to make sure you are well informed on it yourself. 

Make sure you spend an appropriate amount of time researching the issue, using a range of sources - that might include original documents and official reports as well as news reports. For identity-based listicles, speak to a range of people. 

## 3. Select the pieces of information that are going to make up the items in your listicle

The key selling point of a listicle is *brevity*: you're not giving them *all* the information, just a specific number of pieces of information that are essential to understanding the issue. So decide which pieces of information you're going to leave out: it might be elements which don't add anything new, (for example those that only repeat information elsewhere, or which take you down another path).

Aim for at least 6 items in your story: less than that and it feels like it hasn't been properly researched, or doesn't justify the listicle format.

If you haven't got enough information for 6 items, *do some more research* - or ditch the story entirely as not justifying a listicle.

## 4. Write the text of the listicle

The listicle structure is deceptively simple:

* A headline 
* An intro 
* A subheading for each item, 
* One or two sentences of explanation for each item - including links to the source(s). 
* Some sort of image or gif for each item

The **headline** should contain a number and a 'sell' or 'call to action;. Common patterns include '9 things you need to know about X' or '7 reasons why X' or '15 ways you know that you are X' or 'Here are 9 things you might not have known about X'

The **intro** should establish the topical reason for the listicle, e.g. *As political leaders meet to agree targets for action on global warming, here are the 9 reasons that this is the most important meeting yet.*

The **items** should be ordered with some thought about narrative structure and ways that elements might be juxtaposed against each other (for example, to create tension by introducing a question and then answering it). They might be ordered **chronologically** if the listicle is a history; but they might also be ordered to introduce a problem, then possible attempts to solve that, before ending with an elemenet which looks ahead to what happens next.

Each item itself should be detailed in a subheading that communicates the essential information (it should be possible to read the article by just looking at the subheadings), but this can be fleshed out in 1-2 sentences that follow - not too many, or it breaks the implicit promise of a listicle (that it won't have too many words!) Those sentences should **attribute** the information ("According to X" or "X said in 2021 that...") and if possible **link** to it as well (don't use a URL - link the word 'said' or the phrase 'according to X').

Links are a key element in listicles - having lots of links in your article signals that it's well-researched, and that readers will be able to click through to find out more. The absence of links indicates that someone hasn't done much research and/or is too lazy to help the reader find out more.

## 5. Add illustration for each item

Each item should be **illustrated**: you can use an image, or a GIF. Sites like Giphy allow you to search lots of GIFs, or you can use Google Image's options to specify you only want to search GIFs.

Make sure you're not breaking copyright law. 

## 6. Edit the draft

Once you've completed your draft, make sure you edit it. 

* Check spelling and grammar - especially in subheadings where it's easiest to miss typos. Make sure every name is correctly spelt, too.
* Check that every claim is attributed
* Check you've linked to sources
* Check that every item has earned its place - will the listicle still make sense if you remove an item? Then it can probably go.
* Check that every word has earned its place - its common to overwrite your first draft, so look to cut words and whole sentences out in your second.

Once you've completed a second edit, look at it again - a good article is edited multiple times. 

## 7. Publish!

Once it's ready to go, publish the piece and share on social media.
