# How to write a listicle

A **listicle** is an article in the form of a list (the term 'listicle' is a [portmanteau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portmanteau) of the words 'list' and 'article'). 

Listicles normally have a number in the headline, and focus on 'essential' information on a topical issue, e.g. [10 Things You Need To Know About The #GamerGate Scanda](https://whatculture.com/gaming/10-things-need-know-gamergate-scandal). The format can also be used for more identity-based features, e.g. [22 Types Of Customers Every Bartender Hates](http://crazycheshirehatter.blogspot.co.uk/2016/03/22-types-of-customers-every-bartender.html).

The steps to making a listicle are:

1. Identify the topic you are going to write about
2. Research the topic
3. Select the pieces of information that are going to make up the items in your listicle
4. Write the text of the listicle
5. Add illustration for each item
6. Edit the draft
7. Publish!


## 1. Identify the topic you are going to write about

Because a listicle isn't telling the reader anything *new*, there needs to be a reason why it's worth reading - and why an editor would allow you to spend time on it (or commmission it). 

Topics can range from the frivolous and humorous (“11 Random, Amazing Food Videos We Can't Stop Playing On Repeat”) to the serious (“12 Charts That Explain Why You’ll Never, Ever Be Able To Afford A Home”; “16 Absolutely Outrageous Abuses Detailed in the CIA Torture Report”). They work particularly well as a form of curation, rounding up the best or most important information about an issue or event.

The three main reasons are:
* A news event has happened where readers will need to catch up on the background, or find out about the wider issue
* A 'top ten' (but probably not ten)
* A particular type of identity warrants
