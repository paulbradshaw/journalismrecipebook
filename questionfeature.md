# How to: write a 'question' article

If you are considering writing an article where the headline is a question: stop. 

In general, journalists are advised not to raise questions in headlines. This is because journalists are expected to get *answers* to questions, and report those answers. If you haven't got answers to a question, then you have nothing new to report. And if you *have* got a response to that question, well, then the *response* should be the headline (including non-response stories where you can lead with 'X refuses to answer questions about Y').

You can, of course, report that someone else has asked a question, e.g. 'Suspect asks police: "What did I do wrong?"' (you should also seek a response). Reporting that someone has raised a question is not the same thing as raising a question yourself. 

There is even a term for headlines that raise a question: [Betteridge's law of headlines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betteridge%27s_law_of_headlines) says: "Any headline that ends in a question mark can be answered by the word no." (Again, because if the answer was yes, that would be the headline instead). A variant of this is QTWTAIN: an acronym for Questions To Which The Answer Is No. [One Reddit thread is dedicated to examples](https://www.reddit.com/r/QTWTAIN/) such as "Is this the end of the Met Police?". In 2014 Indy100 [published its top ten examples](https://www.indy100.com/news/the-top-10-questions-to-which-the-answer-is-no-in-2014-qtwtain-7255191).

## The exception to the rule: question-driven features

But like every rule, there is an exception to the general principle not to raise a question in a headline. 

Occasionally a journalist will write an **exploratory feature** which explores the *answers* to a particular question. Those answers are absolutely crucial: if you raise a question in a feature headline, you are implying that the article will explore the answers to that, so again: if you haven't got answers, don't write it. 

One example is *[From pope’s jacket to napalm recipes: how worrying is AI’s rapid growth?](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/apr/23/pope-jacket-napalm-recipes-how-worrying-is-ai-rapid-growth)*. 

Exploratory features like this are a version of the [explainer](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/journalismrecipebook/blob/main/explainer.md) and [trend feature](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/journalismrecipebook/blob/main/trendfeature.md), so it is worth exploring those guides as well as this one. 

## Step 1: Identify a topical issue with a complex backstory

Normally there needs to be a **news hook** for your feature: a topical reason why you've decided to spend time exploring this issue *now*. In this example the news hook - a news story that has been reported in the last week - is that the boss of Google has said worries about the growth of AI is keeping him awake at night. Off the back of that story either the journalist has pitched a feature looking in more depth at the background to those concerns, or an editor has asked the reporter to write one.

Look for these potential triggers for an exploratory feature:
* Someone raises concerns ('Why is X worried about Y')
* An event, such as a protest or attack

Often an exploratory feature is also justified by the nature of the issue: in this case AI is a complex field which most people don't pay much attention to. You might get similar stories that raise (and answer) the question 'Why are people talking/worried/excited about X', or 'Why is organisation Y doing Z'.

## Step 2: Get answers

## Step 3: Give the story a headline that is optimised for search

## Step 4: Add a standfirst which establishes the topical reason for the feature

## Step 5: Start the story with the news event that raises the question you're going to answer

## Step 6: Add
