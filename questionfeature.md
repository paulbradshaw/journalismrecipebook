# How to: write a 'question' article

If you are considering writing an article with a question for a headline: **stop**. 

In general, journalists are advised not to raise questions in headlines. This is because journalists are expected to get *answers* to questions, and report those answers. If you haven't got answers to a question, then you have nothing new to report. And if you *have* got a response to that question, well, then the *response* should be the headline (including non-response stories where you can lead with 'X refuses to answer questions about Y').

You can, of course, report that someone else has asked a question, e.g. 'Suspect asks police: "What did I do wrong?"' (you should also seek a response). Reporting that someone has raised a question is not the same thing as raising a question yourself. 

There is even a term for headlines that raise a question: [Betteridge's law of headlines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betteridge%27s_law_of_headlines) says: "Any headline that ends in a question mark can be answered by the word no." (Again, because if the answer was yes, that would be the headline instead). A variant of this is QTWTAIN: an acronym for Questions To Which The Answer Is No. [One Reddit thread is dedicated to examples](https://www.reddit.com/r/QTWTAIN/) such as "Is this the end of the Met Police?". In 2014 Indy100 [published its top ten examples](https://www.indy100.com/news/the-top-10-questions-to-which-the-answer-is-no-in-2014-qtwtain-7255191).

## The exception to the rule: question-driven features

But like every rule, there is an exception to the general principle not to raise a question in a headline. 

Occasionally a journalist will write an **exploratory feature** which explores the *answers* to a particular question. Those answers are absolutely crucial: if you raise a question in a feature headline, you are implying that the article will explore the answers to that, so again: if you haven't got answers, don't write it. 

One example is *[From pope’s jacket to napalm recipes: how worrying is AI’s rapid growth?](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/apr/23/pope-jacket-napalm-recipes-how-worrying-is-ai-rapid-growth)*. 

Exploratory features like this are a version of the [explainer](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/journalismrecipebook/blob/main/explainer.md) and [trend feature](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/journalismrecipebook/blob/main/trendfeature.md), so it is worth exploring those guides as well as this one. 

## Step 1: Identify a topical issue with a complex backstory

Normally there needs to be a **news hook** for an explanatory feature: a topical reason why you've decided to spend time exploring this issue *now*. In the example above the news hook - a news story that has been reported in the last week - is that the boss of Google has said worries about the growth of AI is keeping him awake at night. 

Off the back of that story either the journalist has pitched a feature looking in more depth at the background to those concerns, or an editor has asked the reporter to write one.

Look for these potential triggers for an exploratory feature:
* Someone raises concerns (the explanatory feature would be 'Why is X worried about Y'). Example: *[What is happening to banks and why are people talking about a crisis?](https://www.independent.co.uk/business/what-is-happening-to-banks-and-why-are-people-talking-about-a-crisis-b2302205.html)*
* An event, such as a protest or attack (the explanatory feature might be 'Why did X happen')
* An announcement of new action, or stopping of action (the explanatory feature might be 'Why is X doing/stopping Y') Example: [*Why are people talking about banning TikTok in the UK?*](https://uk.news.yahoo.com/why-are-people-talking-about-banning-tiktok-in-the-uk-125916930.html)
* Someone is in the news. Example: [Who is Donald Trump and why are people talking about him?](https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/65014224)

Often an exploratory feature is also justified by the nature of the issue: in this case AI is a complex field which most people don't pay much attention to. You might get similar stories that raise (and answer) the question 'Why are people talking/worried/excited about X', or 'Why is organisation Y doing Z'.

## Step 2: Get answers

Once you've identified a question which is important and topical enough to justify an explanatory feature, you need to gather enough information to write a feature that answers that question and others that follow on from it. 

That information is likely to include: 

* Previous news reports on the issue. Don't stop here. If these reports mention people or documents (e.g. reports, research) then look at the original reports and contact the people yourselves.
* Official reports - those might be from government bodies but can also be from charities, campaign groups etc.
* Research (focus on the abstract, which sums up the research, and the conclusions at the end)
* Data
* People: experts, campaigners, and those affected

You can write an explanatory feature based entirely on secondary information - but you can also do your own interviews (primary research) to make it better.

## Step 3: Plan the story

Once you've got enough information, start to plan out the story structure. This is likely to follow this sequence:

1. Headline: this is your question, optimised for search engines (the sort of question someone might search for, which your article would answer). It can also include other keywords - note how the AI article prefixes its question with those for example: *From pope’s jacket to napalm recipes: how worrying is AI’s rapid growth?*
2. Standfirst: this is a paragraph (often in bold/bigger type) before the article begins which establishes the topical reason for the feature and states or implies what it will do. In the AI example the standfirst is: *Google boss says issue keeps him up at night, while thousands have urged six-month pause on creation of ‘giant’ AIs*
3. The intro: the first paragraph of the story generally starts with the news event that raises the question you're going to answer: *When the boss of Google admits to losing sleep over the negative potential of artificial intelligence, perhaps it is time to get worried.*
4. Par 2: provide some further background on this event (specific name, when, where etc) which wasn't provided in the intro: *Sundar Pichai told the CBS programme 60 Minutes this month that AI could be “very harmful” if deployed wrongly, and was developing fast. “So does that keep me up at night? Absolutely,” he said.*
5. Par 3 onwards 'pans out' to the bigger picture and background: *Pichai should know. Google has launched Bard, a chatbot to rival the ChatGPT phenomenon, and its parent, Alphabet, owns the world-leading DeepMind, a UK-based AI company. ... He is not the only AI insider to voice concerns.*
6. After a couple pars (not too many) of that bigger picture you can now introduce the 'problem' - your question - and begin to answer it. *So how much of a danger is posed by unrestrained AI development? Musk is one of thousands of signatories to a letter published by the Future of Life Institute, a thinktank, that called for a six-month moratorium on the creation of “giant” AIs more powerful than GPT-4, the system that underpins ChatGPT and the chatbot integrated with Microsoft’s Bing search engine.*
7. Now the rest of the article explores the answers to that question. For example: *The approach to product development shown by AI practitioners and the tech industry would not be tolerated in any other field, said Valérie Pisano, another signatory to the letter. *
8. To keep the momentum going, it's likely that you'll introduce further problems/questions, and answer those. In the AI example there is more than one concern, so each of those can provide a different 'chapter' in the story. One chapter in the AI example is concerns about misinformation; a second is superintelligence. In each chapter you'll probably need to add a little background specific to that. 
9. Once the problems have all been introduced you start to move to *what is being done* (or planned/proposed) - and any criticisms/potential problems with those actions. This is the last section before the ending.
10. Finally, you need an ending. Look for elements in your story which look forward - it might be a fact about something planned, or a quote about the future. In the AI example (which isn't a great ending) it ends saying that one person is pointing "to the need for a nuclear arms-style global framework" and ends with the forward-looking quote: "there have to be serious consequences if [a] line is crossed."

## Step 4 (optional): Fill in the gaps

Planning out your story is a good way to identify any gaps in the information you've gathered so far. If there are gaps you might now set out to fill those (you can put placeholder text in your article and have it ready for the missing info), with the advantage that your research is now much more targeted and therefore quicker to do. 

Don't forget to get imagery or other media for your story: if complex concepts are being explained, is there an image that can help with that? If someone is quoted, can we see their face? (Which makes it much more accessible). 

## Step 5: Edit!

Once everything is gathered and you've written your story - edit it! 

You should never stop at a first draft, and with an explanatory feature it's very likely that you'll have written too much. Look at your article with fresh eyes and aim to make it sharper and punchier. You may have been buried in the detail of this issue, but remember that the purpose of this article is to be succinct and accessible to a reader who isn't as interested in this as you have been!

Some particular things to look out for are:
* 'Warming up' intros: have you got to the point in your first par? Did you move on quickly enough?
* Sections that are 'diversions': it's easy to go off down a side road in this issue which isn't actually central. Remove the whole section!
* Overlong quotes: if they've made the point, move on
* Long sections without quotes: either cut them back or try to find quotes to break things up
* Too many numbers: consider putting them in a chart instead
* The lack of a clear ending (see above)
* Don't forget to check the spelling of every name in the article, and to check grammar issues such as capitalisation (see the BCU style guide)

## Step 6: Publish and distribute

Once you've published the article, don't forget to write material for social media. Those might be individual updates but you can also re-tell the story (or part of it) as a thread, 'story', etc.
