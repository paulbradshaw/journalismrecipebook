# How to: write a colour piece, or 'sketch' feature

A colour piece is a feature which describes what it is like to 'be there', typically at a major news event. Less important events wouldn't justify the extra article, so for that reason colour pieces are not as common as other types of feature. (An exception is *[What would happen if Russia invaded Finland? I went to a giant war game in London to find out](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/sep/30/what-would-happen-if-russia-invaded-finland-i-went-to-a-giant-war-game-in-london-to-find-out)*.)

Examples of major news events where an editor may commission a colour piece include:

* Major sporting events (such as a Champions League or Wimbledon final, an Olympics or Commonwealth Games, etc)
* Major trial (something with widespread attention, such as the Wagatha Christie trial, or Johnny Depp vs Amber Heard for example)
* A major political event, such as the resignation of a prime minister or a [mayoral election](https://www.birminghamdispatch.co.uk/p/a-day-of-high-drama-inside-the-toppling?utm_source=substack&publication_id=2048775&post_id=144326893&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&utm_campaign=email-share&triggerShare=true&isFreemail=false&r=h8or&triedRedirect=true)

Whereas news events focus on the facts of news events (what happened, when, with who, where, how and why), and interview features focus on what someone has said, the colour feature focuses on *details* that provide a different type of insight into the event in question. For example, if the news event was the Wimbledon final, then here are the different stories that might be commissioned:

* A news story might focus on what the coach has said they plan to do to prepare
* An interview feature might involve speaking to a former winner on what it's like to win at Wimbledon
* A colour piece would seek to convey what it's like on the day of the final: the sights, sounds and smells; the expressions that give away particular emotions. The curious things, the funny things, the quirky things. 

Gathering those details takes some planning: you will almost certainly need to travel to a key location (or locations) such as the final venue, local pubs, train station, etc. You may need to do some brief interviews to get some quotes. And you'll need to do background research as well - not all the colour will come from the location itself; and the research will help give you ideas where to go and who to speak to.

## Working through an example

One example to look at for ideas and inspiration is [Bowls, boxing, basketball: Birmingham’s bonanza of sport](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jul/29/bowls-boxing-basketball-birminghams-bonanza-of-sport). 

In this case the major news event - the justification for writing - is the Commonwealth Games. The journalist, Andy Bull, has had to decide which locations to go to in order to gather the details he needs for his feature - the 'colour', in other words. He decides to go to Leamington Spa, the NEC, and Smithfield in central Birmingham. Leamington Spa was probably chosen because background research would have pointed him towards the bowls taking part there as being one of the quirkier games, with Fiji sending 0.5% of their population to compete in that event. This allows him to pick out some of those odd details. The boxing at the NEC also allows him to focus on some underdogs; and the 3x3 basketball at Smithfields is a new event, so is more newsworthy. 

The article is full of background research on competitors and events, but also quotes from people he speaks to at venues and at train stations - transport is a big part of the story, because of the organisers' aim to get people using public transport (and the wider issues around problems with public transport). There are observations about the crowding on the trains and platforms but also the lack of spectators for the bowls, and the strange 'atmosphere' of bowls. 

## Sketch writing

Many news organisations employ a 'sketch writer' to write colour pieces about what's going on in Parliament. A 'sketch' is a special form of colour piece with an increased emphasis on wit and personality. The Guardian's parliamentary sketch writer is [John Crace](https://www.theguardian.com/profile/johncrace), for example. Most weeks the sketch will focus on Prime Minister's Questions (a major news event) but at other times it might focus on another major political news event, such as a [TV debate](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/26/surreal-tv-debate-another-bizarre-moment-tory-leadership-contest).

Sketch writers are useful to read to get inspiration on how to write a good colour piece, too. 

## Steps to take

So how do you identify and plan a colour piece? Here are some steps:

1. Identify a major news event in advance - sports calendars would be a good place to look. 
2. Do some background research on the event, identifying key people and places and themes (e.g. transport and underdogs were themes in the example above) that might have a role to play in your story
3. Identify the location(s) you will need to report from. You'll need be able to access these financially (e.g. travel costs) and logistically (e.g. access - see below). That location might not be the event itself: for example if it was a major boxing clash you could do a colour piece from the boxing club where the defending champion was trained, as they watch the fight on TV
4. Organise access to the location(s) you want to report from. For example, applying for accreditation/media access, or buying tickets, or approaching the owner of the boxing club/etc.
5. Do further background research in the lead up to the event, including any conversations with key people whose quotes you might include
6. Attend the event, making frequent notes about things that can help the reader get a sense for its quirks and details. Not just sights (details), but sounds (overheard remarks, announcements, unusual noises), smells, tastes, and sensations. And speak to lots of people - get their full names, jobs, where they're from and why they came. These are all details that form part of the picture. What they think doesn't really matter: it's who they are and what their relationship is like with the event itself (are they mega fans or vaguely interested? Did they travel thousands of miles or wander round the corner?) Take pictures and record video to help you remember aspects of the event later.
7. Once the event has finished, write up your colour feature. If the event lasts more than a day then you'll have more time to write it - but if it's just on one day, you'll need to write it quickly, within less than 24 hours. 

## A typical colour feature structure

Look at lots of examples to help you plan and write your colour feature quickly. A typical structure might look like this:

Beginning: A snapshot or anecdote - begin by painting a scene from the event. An obvious one might be the first thing you see upon arriving or entering. This paragraph might include some basic details about the event, the when, where, what. You then might go on to add some background (why, who, how)

Middle: Alternate between passages of colour, and passages of background research/details which put those details into context. Don't be afraid to describe things in a colourful way, or to have a personality in the way you write (a personality is not the same thing as an opinion - a good colour piece has enough description to help the audience form their own opinion). Metaphors and similes and comparisons can be used effectively here. 

End: A final snapshot might be a good way to end the feature, especially if it hints at the future, or circles back to something observed earlier in the piece (e.g. you return to a person you quoted earlier)

In some ways a colour feature is similar to an interview feature in structure, in that an interview feature interweaves quotes with background context to those quotes. The colour feature simply replaces quotes with observations, weaving those in with background instead. Colour features are also often chronological in structure (although they 'flashback' throughout to background information): following the event from start to finish. This makes it easier to write quickly. 

## The 'experience' feature

A similar format to the sketch is the 'experience' feature where a reporter undergoes a particular experience to provide an insight into that. One example is '[Grappling with Zuckerberg: why do bros go mad for Brazilian jiu-jitsu?](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/may/12/grappling-with-zuckerberg-why-do-bros-go-mad-for-brazilian-jiu-jitsu)' by Zoe Williams (it's no coincidence that she is an opinion columnnist: these stories require strong writing skills). As is so often the case, the basis for exploring this particular experience is justified by a news hook in the second par: 

> "Most recently, Mark Zuckerberg revealed on his social media accounts this week that he had won gold and silver in a tournament. He joins various actors who may have confused themselves with their roles: Henry Cavill, who played Superman, Tom Hardy, of Mad Max: Fury Road fame, and Guy Ritchie, the director of King Arthur: Legend of the Sword. Russell Brand also enjoys the martial art, always at the front of the queue whenever anything fashionable and ostentatiously muscular – either physically or politically – is in the offing."

It's also worth noting that this journalist has been here before, with '[Fit in my 40s: will Brazilian jiu-jitsu give me a body like Hercules?](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/sep/14/fit-in-my-40s-brazilian-jiujitsu-zoe-williams)' - part of a series including [Fit in my 40s: welcome to the velodrome. You’ll need nerves of steel](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/jul/27/fit-in-40s-velodrome-need-nerves-of-steel-zoe-williams).
