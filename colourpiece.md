# How to: write a colour piece, or 'sketch' feature

A colour piece is a feature which describes what it is like to 'be there', typically at a major news event. Less important events wouldn't justify the extra article, so for that reason colour pieces are not as common as other types of feature. 

Examples of major news events where an editor may commission a colour piece include:

* Major sporting events (such as a Champions League or Wimbledon final, an Olympics or Commonwealth Games, etc)
* Major trial (something with widespread attention, such as the Wagatha Christie trial, or Johnny Depp vs Amber Heard for example)
* A major political event, such as the resignation of a prime minister

Whereas news events focus on the facts of news events (what happened, when, with who, where, how and why), and interview features focus on what someone has said, the colour feature focuses on *details* that provide a different type of insight into the event in question. For example, if the news event was the Wimbledon final, then here are the different stories that might be commissioned:

* A news story might focus on what the coach has said they plan to do to prepare
* An interview feature might involve speaking to a former winner on what it's like to win at Wimbledon
* A colour piece would seek to convey what it's like on the day of the final: the sights, sounds and smells; the expressions that give away particular emotions. The curious things, the funny things, the quirky things. 

Gathering those details takes some planning: you will almost certainly need to travel to a key location (or locations) such as the final venue, local pubs, train station, etc. You may need to do some brief interviews to get some quotes. And you'll need to do background research as well - not all the colour will come from the location itself; and the research will help give you ideas where to go and who to speak to.

## Working through an example

One example to look at for ideas and inspiration is [Bowls, boxing, basketball: Birminghamâ€™s bonanza of sport](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jul/29/bowls-boxing-basketball-birminghams-bonanza-of-sport).

In this case the major news event - the justification for writing - is the Commonwealth Games. The journalist, Andy Bull, has had to decide which locations to go to in order to gather the details he needs for his feature - the 'colour', in other words. 

## Sketch writing

Many news organisations employ a 'sketch writer' to write colour pieces about what's going on in Parliament. A 'sketch' is a special form of colour piece with an increased emphasis on wit and personality. The Guardian's parliamentary sketch writer is [John Crace](https://www.theguardian.com/profile/johncrace), for example. Most weeks the sketch will focus on Prime Minister's Questions (a major news event) but at other times it might focus on another major political news event, such as a [TV debate](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/26/surreal-tv-debate-another-bizarre-moment-tory-leadership-contest).

Sketch writers are useful to read to get inspiration on how to write a good colour piece, too.
