# How to edit a 'first person account'

Sometimes in news you will speak to, or be approached by, someone with an account so striking that it will be newsworthy in its own right - in other words, as well as a news story about their account, you will want to publish the account itself as a standalone piece. 

One example is *[‘Dejected and desperate’: the ordeal of a mental health patient left in limbo](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jul/04/dejected-and-desperate-the-ordeal-of-a-mental-health-patient-left-in-limbo)*, 'written' by the parents of an 18-year-old woman who waited eight-and-a-half days in A&E.

I say 'written' because it would be unusual for a person's account to be published exactly as it was written - if someone isn't a journalist themselves, it is rare for them to write an account in a way that would make it ready to be published without any editing. 

Here, then, are the steps in editing such an account:

1. Ask for, or create, a record of their experience
2. Edit the account for structure, succinctness, accuracy, and legal/ethical rigour
3. Write a headline
4. Write a standfirst

## 1. Ask for, or create, a record of their experience

When you encounter, or are approached by, the person with the experience you will need to get as much information as possible. This will depend on what information they've already given you:

* If they have sent you a written account, then you will probably need to ask follow-up questions to flesh it out and clarify certain aspects (see the editing stage below for some pointers)
* If they have only mentioned the experience, then you will need to ask if you could speak to (or correspond with) them to record enough details about the experience to fill an article. Try to get them to describe the experience from the start - including any events before the experience itself which are important in putting it into context.

Once you've got it down 'on paper', you then need to move on to editing it.

## 2. Edit the account for structure, succinctness, concreteness, accuracy, and legal/ethical rigour

The story of their experience may be important - but it will also need to be engaging enough for people to want to read the whole thing. A sound **structure** will make sure that people do not lose interest.

Probably the most common structure will be a *chronological* one. This wouldn't be appropriate for a news story, which would use an inverted pyramid structure - but this will *not be a news story* (you should write a separate news article based on the account): it will be a '**news feature**'.

Once you've ordered the account into chronological order, you might notice periods that are missing which a reader would have questions about. If that's the case, don't be afraid to go back to the source and ask more questions to fill those gaps.

Now you need to make the story **succinct**: what might be an important detail to your source won't always be relevant to your audience, or to the core story. So go through your article and chop out any parts which will are digressions from the main events, or don't add to the story. A key test is: if the story still makes sense without a section, cut it out.

You need to make sure the story is **accurate, and concrete**. Identify any places, people or organisations in the story and make sure that those are identified (concrete). If any details are vague, try to establish more detail. If a setting is important, ask for more description in case that helps engage the reader.

Finally, you need to consider any **legal or ethical issues**. For example, if the account involves details that would cause the reader to think badly of a person or organisation, then you need to consider *defamation* law. If the story relates to an ongoing court case then *contempt* should be considered. And if it relates to a person's health or finances or other personal details, then *privacy* law and ethics should be considered. Consult with an editor (or tutor).

## 3. Write a headline 

Although the story is effectively 'by' the source, the headline and standfirst (a paragraph that introduces the article) are not. 

For example, the headline of the example was *[‘Dejected and desperate’: the ordeal of a mental health patient left in limbo](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jul/04/dejected-and-desperate-the-ordeal-of-a-mental-health-patient-left-in-limbo)*. 

This combines a short quote with a colon, and then a second part which indicates that this is a first person account. While headlines are normally verb-led ('revealed', 'announces', 'launches' etc) this is more descriptive, with the verb *implied* by the quote (in this case she *felt* dejected and desperate and the fact that it is a quote implies that she *shares* her experience).

## 4. Write a standfirst

The standfirst 'sums up' the story and comes before the quoted person's account. In the print edition of the story it's often in bold and/or italics. In fact, confusingly, [the online version](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jul/04/dejected-and-desperate-the-ordeal-of-a-mental-health-patient-left-in-limbo) has *two* standfirsts. The first is this:

> *The parents of Louise, 18, describe her ordeal as she waited for mental health support in an NHS A&E for eight days*

And the second, which is the one used on its own in print, is this:

> *David and Angela, the parents of the 18-year-old woman who endured an eight-and-a-half day-long spell in A&E waiting for a mental health bed, describe her and their ordeal.*

I'd suggest that this is an oversight - you only really need one or the other. You also need to link this story to the news article it relates to, so the phrase "endured an eight-and-a-half day-long spell" should really be linked to that story.

Notice that the standfirst isn't written in the voice of the person who is writing the account - it's the voice of the publication. It serves to introduce the person who is speaking (in this case David and Angela - normally you would include surnames unless there's a good reason not to) and what the article will cover.
