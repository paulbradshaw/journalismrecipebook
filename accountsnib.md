# How to write: a NIB (News In Brief) based on company accounts

A simple way to get started using company accounts for stories is to write a NIB (News In Brief) - a short (2-4 paragraph) story.

Here are the steps:

1. Subscribe to alerts for when a company's accounts are made public
2. Identify which aspect of the accounts you want to focus on
3. Write the NIB, following a particular 'model'

## 1. Subscribe to alerts for when a company's accounts are made public

The Companies House website allows you to 'follow' any company when you get to their page (you'll need to register on the site first, which is free). 

Once you click the green 'follow' button on a company's page on Companies House, you'll get email alerts when they submit new filings, such as annual accounts. 

Consider following companies that are on your 'beat' as a journalist - for example major employers in your local area, or key organisations in your field (sport, education, etc) - and also those that are generally newsworthy - for example, because they've been in the news or have famous connections. 

## 2. Identify which aspect of the accounts you want to focus on

When you are alerted to a new set of accounts coming out (or you can just do this for the latest accounts, for practice), open the accounts and look at the areas most likely to provide a news story. These are:

* The director's statement at the front: have they said anything newsworthy?
* The cash flow statement (sometimes called the statement of income): this shows how much business a company is doing (turnover) and profits, plus tax etc.
* The 'going concern' statement where they might identify 'material risks and uncertainties' (potential problems)

## 3. Write the NIB, following a particular 'model'

Here are three common models for writing a company accounts NIB:

1. The 'change' story: first par says how much something has changed, in percentage terms; second par gives the specific numbers; third par adds a quote from the director's report
2. The 'scale' story: first par says how big something was (e.g. the size of profits; director's pay); second par adds details on how much that was up or down from the previous year; third par adds a quote from the director's report
3. The 'quote' story: first par paraphrases something that was said in the report (e.g. warning about something); second par gives the specific quote and name of the person if known; third par adds a figure from the report, e.g. scale of profits or how much they went up or down

Which one you choose depends on which aspect you think is most newsworthy. 

Here are examples of each:

### The change story

Profits at online grocers Amozan increased by 20% in the latest financial year, according to newly published accounts.

The company reported profits on £36m in the year to October 2022 - up from £30m the previous year. 

Director Sam Hall said: "This year we have expanded into a number of new markets, where we have performed better than expected."


### The scale story

Online grocers Amozan have announced profits of £36m in their latest accounts.

The figure, covering the year to October 2022, represents a rise of 20% on the previous year, when the company reported profits £30m. 

Director Sam Hall said: "This year we have expanded into a number of new markets, where we have performed better than expected."


### The quote story

The director of online grocers Amozan says they intend to continue their expansion into new markets after new accounts showed a big incrfease in profits.

Sam Hall, who took over as director last year, said: "This year we have expanded into a number of new markets, where we have performed better than expected. The strategic objective for the next 12 months is to expand even further."

The company made profits of £36m in the year to October 2022, a rise of 20% on the previous year.
