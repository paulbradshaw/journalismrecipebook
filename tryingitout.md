# How to write: a "trying it out" feature

If a particular activity is in the news (topical), you or an editor might pitch/propose doing a first person feature where the journalist tries out that activity. 

One example is Zoe Williams's *[Grappling with Zuckerberg: why do bros go mad for Brazilian jiu-jitsu?](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/may/12/grappling-with-zuckerberg-why-do-bros-go-mad-for-brazilian-jiu-jitsu)* (the print headline was *Brazilian jiu-jitsu: getting ripped and keeping up with the tech bros*).

Here's how to write it:

1. Identify an activity that's in the news (it could be a trend, or something a famous person has said/admitted they do)
2. Pitch the story (will readers of the target publication care?)
3. Conduct background research, including any interviews
4. Organise the activity, including ensuring the presence of any key people
5. Do the activity, taking photos, notes, and video/audio if needed
6. Write up a first draft
7. Edit
8. Rewrite, edit again, and publish!

## 1. Identify an activity that's in the news (it could be a trend, or something a famous person has said/admitted they do)

The topicality is key here: the feature should justify in the first par or two why the journalist is being given the time to indulge in this practice. In Williams's feature, that comes in par 2 of the article: 

> Most recently, Mark Zuckerberg revealed on his social media accounts this week that [he had won gold and silver in a tournament(https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/may/08/mark-zuckerberg-tom-hardy-list-celebrity-brazilian-jiu-jitsu-fighters). He joins various actors who may have confused themselves with their roles: Henry Cavill, who played Superman, Tom Hardy, of Mad Max: Fury Road fame, and Guy Ritchie, the director of King Arthur: Legend of the Sword. Russell Brand also enjoys the martial art, always at the front of the queue whenever anything fashionable and ostentatiously muscular – either physically or politically – is in the offing.

3. Conduct background research, including any interviews
4. Organise the activity, including ensuring the presence of any key people
5. Do the activity, taking photos, notes, and video/audio if needed
